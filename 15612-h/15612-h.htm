<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE" />PREFACE</h2>


<p class="preface">The purpose of the translator in offering to the public this version of
the <i>Genesis</i> is to aid in forwarding&mdash;be it by but one jot or
tittle&mdash;the general knowledge and appreciation of Old English
literature. Professed students in this department will always have an
incentive to master the language; but to the public at large the
strangeness of this medium will prove an insurmountable barrier, and the
general reader must therefore either remain in ignorance of our older
literary monuments or else employ translations. The present
contribution<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the growing body of such translations possesses,
perhaps, more than a single interest or appeal, in that it renders
accessible not only a poem of considerable intrinsic worth, a poem
associated with the earliest of the great names in English literary
history, and a forerunner and possible source of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, but
also an important example of a literary <i>genre</i> once immensely popular,
though now quite fallen into abeyance&mdash;namely, the lengthy versified
Scriptural paraphrase. For some idea of the prominent part played by
this form, even so late as the seventeenth century, the reader is
referred to any comprehensive manual of English literature.</p>

<p class="preface">In this translation, prose has been employed instead of verse, for two
reasons. In the first place, no metrical <span class="pagenum">Page 137</span><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>form has yet been found which,
in the writer's judgment, at all adequately represents in modern English
the effect of the Old English alliterative verse, or stave-rime. And in
the second place, to the writer's thinking, no one but a poet should
attempt to write verse: and on that principle, translations would be few
and far between, unless prose were used.</p>

<p class="preface">But even granting the value of the <i>Genesis</i> as a fit subject for
translation, and the necessity for the employment of prose, the reader
may still quarrel with the particular <i>kind</i> of prose hereinbelow
essayed; so a brief explanation and, it is hoped, vindication of the
theory of translation here followed would seem desirable, inasmuch as
considerable divergence is intended from the methods adopted by the
various translators of the <i>Beowulf</i>, for example. First, Biblical
phraseology has been eschewed, partly because in a modern writer it
savors of affectation, but chiefly because his Bible was the point of
departure for the Old English author, and to return now in the
translation to our Bible would be a stultification of his purposes by a
sort of <i>argumentum in circulo</i>. Secondly, archaisms, poetic diction,
and unusual constructions (the &quot;translation English&quot; anathematized by
the Rhetorics) have been so far as possible avoided, contrary to the
practice of most translators from Old English poetry, because it is felt
strongly that such usages will not produce upon modern readers the
effect that this poetry produced originally upon the readers or hearers
for whom it was intended. For this poetry could not have seemed alien or
exotic to its original public: either through familiar poetic
convention, or owing to the staccato and ejaculatory character of
ordinary spoken language at the time, this spasmodic, apostrophic poetry
must have seemed natural and beautiful, in the seventh or eighth
century. But&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="pagenum">Page 138</span><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>
Why take the style of those heroic times?<br />
For nature brings not back the mastodon,<br />
Nor we those times.<br />
</p>

<p class="preface">To translate is to modernize. This rendering, therefore, is not an
artificial, pseudo-antique hybrid, but frankly endeavors to convey its
original to modern readers in idiomatic modern literary English, devoid
of any conscious mannerisms whatsoever. The writer has aimed at the
utmost literal fidelity consistent with the observance of all the usages
of current standard English; he has not attempted, however, to convert
the explosive appositions, with prevailing asyndeton and excessive
synonymy, of his original into the easy, flowing sentences more familiar
to modern eyes and ears, for the change would sacrifice altogether too
much of the distinctive character and flavor of Old English poetry.</p>

<p class="preface">The text upon which this work is based is that of the Grein-W&uuml;lker
<i>Bibliothek der Angels&auml;chsischen Poesie,</i> 1894, save for a few minor
changes in punctuation and the few departures recorded in the Notes.
Grein's translation of the poem into modern German stave-rime, 1857, has
been frequently consulted, but the writer's real indebtedness to it is
felt to be slight. He takes great pleasure, finally, in acknowledging
his deep sense of obligation, on many grounds, to the general editor of
this series, Professor Albert S. Cook; the work was undertaken at his
suggestion, and he has been most kind in giving advice and criticism.</p>

<p class="nowrap">
Ours is a great duty&mdash;to praise in word and love at<br />
heart the heavens' Ruler, the glorious King of Hosts:<br />
He is the substance of all power, the head of all high<br />
things, the Lord Almighty. Origin or beginning was<span class="linenum">5</span><a name="Line_5" id="Line_5"></a><br />
never made for Him, nor shall an end ever come to the<br />
eternal God: but, on the contrary, He is for ever supreme<br />
by His high puissance over the heavenly kingdoms;<br />
just and mighty, He rules the mansions of the sky,<span class="linenum">10</span><a name="Line_10" id="Line_10"></a><br />
which were established far and wide through the power<br />
of God for the sons of glory, the keepers of souls.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
These angelic hosts were wont to feel joy and rapture,<br />
transcendent bliss, in the presence of their Creator:<br />
their beatitude was measureless. Glorious ministers<span class="linenum">15</span><a name="Line_15" id="Line_15"></a><br />
magnified their Lord, spoke his praise with zeal, lauded<br />
the Master of their being, and were excellently happy<br />
in the majesty of God. They had no knowledge of<br />
working evil or wickedness, but dwelt in innocence<span class="linenum">20</span><a name="Line_20" id="Line_20"></a><br />
forever with their Lord: from the beginning they wrought<br />
in heaven nothing but righteousness and truth, until<br />
a Prince of angels through pride strayed into sin: then<br />
they would consult their own advantage no longer, but<br />
turned away from God's lovingkindness. They had<span class="linenum">25</span><a name="Line_25" id="Line_25"></a><br />
vast arrogance, in that by the might of multitudes they<br />
sought to wrest from the Lord the celestial mansions,<br />
spacious and heaven-bright. Then there fell upon<br />
them, grievously, the envy, presumption, and pride<br />
of the Angel who first began to carry out the evil plot,<span class="linenum">30</span><a name="Line_30" id="Line_30"></a><br />
to weave it and promote it, when he boasted by word&mdash;<br />
as he thirsted for conflict&mdash;that he wished to own the<br />
home and high throne of the heavenly kingdom to the<br />
north. Thereupon God became angered and hostile<span class="linenum">35</span><a name="Line_35" id="Line_35"></a><br />
towards the beings whom he had formerly exalted in<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 142</span><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>
beauty and glory: he created for the traitors a marvelous<br />
abode as penalty for their action, namely the pangs of<br />
Hell, bitter afflictions; Our Lord called forth that<span class="linenum">40</span><a name="Line_40" id="Line_40"></a><br />
abysmal joyless house of punishment to wait for the<br />
outcast keepers of souls.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When he knew that it was<br />
ready, he enveloped it in eternal night and equipped it<br />
with torment, filling it with fire and fearful cold, with<br />
fume and red flame: then he commanded the terrors<br />
of suffering to increase throughout that hapless place.<span class="linenum">45</span><a name="Line_45" id="Line_45"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
They had committed a dire sin against God: on that<br />
account dire punishment befell them. They asserted,<br />
in fierce mood, that they wished to seize the kingdom<br />
and could easily do so: but this presumption mocked<br />
them when their Lord, the high King of heaven, lifted<span class="linenum">50</span><a name="Line_50" id="Line_50"></a><br />
up his almighty hand against the throng. The mad<br />
rebels, accursed ones, could not make head against God,<br />
but the Highest troubled their spirits and humbled their<br />
pride, for he was incensed; he stripped the sinners of<span class="linenum">55</span><a name="Line_55" id="Line_55"></a><br />
victory and might, of dominion and honor, and further<br />
took from his foes happiness, peace, and all joys, as well<br />
as bright glory, and finally, with his own exceeding power,<br />
wreaked his wrath on his adversaries in mighty ruin.<span class="linenum">60</span><a name="Line_60" id="Line_60"></a><br />
He was stern in mood, grimly embittered, and seized<br />
upon his foes with resistless grasp and broke them in<br />
his grip, enraged at heart, and deprived his opponents of<br />
their native seat,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> their bright abodes on high. For<span class="linenum">65</span><a name="Line_65" id="Line_65"></a><br />
our Creator dismissed and banished from heaven the<br />
overweening band of angels: the Lord sent away on a<br />
long journey the faithless multitude, the hateful host,<br />
the miserable spirits; their pride was broken, their threat<span class="linenum">70</span><a name="Line_70" id="Line_70"></a><br />
overthrown, their glory shattered, and their beauty<br />
dimmed; thenceforth they abode in desolation, because<br />
of their dark exile. They did not dare to laugh aloud,<br />
but lived wearied by the torments of hell and became<br />
familiar with woes, bitterness, and sorrow; covered with<span class="linenum">75</span><a name="Line_75" id="Line_75"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 143</span><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>
darkness, they bore their pain,&mdash;a heavy sentence,<br />
because they had begun to battle against God.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then, as formerly, true peace existed in heaven, fair<br />
amity: for the Lord was dear to all, the Sovereign to his<span class="linenum">80</span><a name="Line_80" id="Line_80"></a><br />
servants; and the majesty of the joyful angelic hosts<br />
increased, through the favor of the Almighty.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
So those who inhabited the sky, home of glory, were<br />
at peace; hatred was gone, as well as sorrow and strife<br />
among angels, ever since the rebellious hosts, bereft of the<span class="linenum">85</span><a name="Line_85" id="Line_85"></a><br />
light, had relinquished heaven. Behind them stood in<br />
grandeur their seats rich in glorious workmanship, teeming<br />
with blessings in God's kingdom, bright and perennially<br />
bountiful,&mdash;but all devoid of occupants, ever since the<span class="linenum">90</span><a name="Line_90" id="Line_90"></a><br />
miserable spirits had gone to their place of punishment,<br />
their vile prison. Then our Lord bethought him, in<br />
meditative mood, how he might people again, and with<br />
a better race, his high creation, the noble seats and glory-<span class="linenum">95</span><a name="Line_95" id="Line_95"></a><br />
crowned abodes which the haughty rebels had left<br />
vacant, high in heaven. Therefore Holy God willed by<br />
his plenteous power that under the circle of the firma-<br />
ment the earth should be established, with sky above and<span class="linenum">100</span><a name="Line_100" id="Line_100"></a><br />
wide water, a world-creation in place of the foes whom<br />
in their apostasy he hurled from bliss.<br />

As yet there was nothing at all created here, except<br />
shadows, but this broad earth stood deep and dim, idle<span class="linenum">105</span><a name="Line_105" id="Line_105"></a><br />
and useless, alien even to God himself; on it the King<br />
whose purpose never falters turned his eyes and beheld<br />
the place void of joy; he saw dark clouds, black under<br />
the firmament, throng in the eternal night, dun and<span class="linenum">110</span><a name="Line_110" id="Line_110"></a><br />
waste, until this world-creation came to pass through<br />
the word of the King of Glory. First the everlasting<br />

victorious might established this ample world. The<br />
earth was as yet unadorned by vegetation: the ocean<br />
covered it far and wide, turbid waves in the eternal<br />
night. Then was the glorious Spirit of heaven's guardian<span class="linenum">120</span><a name="Line_120" id="Line_120"></a><br />
borne over the sea with sovereign virtue. For the King<br />
of the angels commanded Light, dispenser of life, to<br />
come forth over the broad expanse: quickly was the<br />
Arch-King's mandate fulfilled, and Holy Light appeared<span class="linenum">125</span><a name="Line_125" id="Line_125"></a><br />
over the waste spaces, as the Creator had ordained it.<br />
The Wielder of Victory next sundered light from darkness,<br />
shadow from radiance, over the surge of the sea. Then<br />
he formed the two names of the dispensers of life: light<br />
was first called &quot;Day&quot; by the word of the Lord, a<span class="linenum">130</span><a name="Line_130" id="Line_130"></a><br />

Time now went forth over the frame-work of the<span class="linenum">135</span><a name="Line_135" id="Line_135"></a><br />

fashioned the first evening, but on its track rushed a<br />

Then the second day advanced, light after darkness;<br />
and the Ruler of Life straightway commanded a glad<span class="linenum">145</span><a name="Line_145" id="Line_145"></a><br />

The flood was divided under the high heavens by holy<br />

Then swiftly came advancing over the world the third<span class="linenum">155</span><a name="Line_155" id="Line_155"></a><br />
great morn. Nor were the spreading lands and ways<br />
yet deemed needful by our Lord, but the earth stood<br />
girt fast by water. Through his word, the Ruler of<br />
the angels bade the waters be gathered together, which<br />
now hold their course beneath the skies in an appointed<span class="linenum">160</span><a name="Line_160" id="Line_160"></a><br />

under heaven, as the Holy One commanded, for the<br />
flood was sundered from the dry land. Thereupon<br />
Life's Ruler looked upon the dry land, the Preserver of<br />
mankind [found it] widely visible, and the King of<span class="linenum">165</span><a name="Line_165" id="Line_165"></a><br />

The Ruler of Heaven did not think it fitting that<span class="linenum">170</span><a name="Line_170" id="Line_170"></a><br />
Adam, the keeper of Paradise and shepherd of the new<br />
creation, should be alone any longer: so the supreme<br />
King, Ruler Almighty, made a companion for him&mdash;<br />
created Woman, and gave this helpmate to his cherished<span class="linenum">175</span><a name="Line_175" id="Line_175"></a><br />
Man as the first and fruitful light of his life. He took his<br />
material from Adam's body and skilfully removed a<br />
rib from his side: the latter was deep in repose and<br />
slumbered peacefully; he felt no pain, though a little<span class="linenum">180</span><a name="Line_180" id="Line_180"></a><br />
uneasiness, nor did a drop of blood come from the wound,<br />
but the Prince of the Angels took from his body a living<br />
bone while the man was unwounded. From this God<br />
fashioned a noble woman, and put into her the breath<br />
of life and an immortal soul: these two were like the<span class="linenum">185</span><a name="Line_185" id="Line_185"></a><br />
angels. Thus was Adam's bride<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> endowed with a<br />
living spirit. They were both radiantly beautiful in their<br />
youthfulness, in the world prepared by the might of<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 146</span><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>
the Lord: they did not know how to undertake or<span class="linenum">190</span><a name="Line_190" id="Line_190"></a><br />
work evil, but on the contrary there was in the breast<br />
of each a burning love of God. Then the benign King,<br />
Ruler of everyone born of the race of man, blessed these<br />
first two creatures, father and mother, woman and<br />
man. Thereafter he spoke these words:<span class="linenum">195</span><a name="Line_195" id="Line_195"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Be fruitful now and increase; fill the verdant earth<br />

our Saviour and merciful Father wished to find out<br />

To him then God at once replied:<br />

&quot;Tell me this, my son: why do you seek the shadows,<br />
in shame? You certainly received no disgrace at my<span class="linenum">875</span><a name="Line_875" id="Line_875"></a><br />

Likewise to Adam did the Eternal Lord, Source of<span class="linenum">925</span><a name="Line_925" id="Line_925"></a><br />

&quot;Thou shalt seek another country, a joyless dwelling-<br />

away from the blessings of paradise; the separation of<br />
soul and body is now ordained for thee. Lo, thou hast<br />
wickedly originated sin: therefore thou shalt toil, and<br />
win thy sustenance on earth by thyself, acquire it by<br />
the sweat of thy face, and thus eat thy bread so long<span class="linenum">935</span><a name="Line_935" id="Line_935"></a><br />
as thou livest here,&mdash;until ungentle disease, which thou<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Behold, we learn thus how bitter afflictions and uni-<span class="linenum">940</span><a name="Line_940" id="Line_940"></a><br />
versal miseries came upon us.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Thereupon the Guardian of Glory, our Creator, girded<br />
them with clothing; the Lord bade them cover their<br />
nakedness with some simple garments, and bade them<br />
set forth and depart from paradise into a harder life.<br />
Behind them, by God's command, a holy angel with a<span class="linenum">945</span><a name="Line_945" id="Line_945"></a><br />
fiery sword shut the gate of their blissful home of peace<br />
and joy; nor may any guileful sin-stained man ever fare<br />
thither again, for the warder has might and strength<span class="linenum">950</span><a name="Line_950" id="Line_950"></a><br />
who keeps for the Lord that greater life rich in glories.<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 150</span><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>
Yet the Almighty, our First Father, would not take<br />
away all comforts from Adam and Eve, though they had<br />
fallen away from him: but he still let the lofty roof<span class="linenum">955</span><a name="Line_955" id="Line_955"></a><br />
studded with holy stars stand as a solace for them, and<br />
gave them ample possessions, and bade the seas and<br />
land bring forth for the pair multitudes of each of the<br />
young-producing species [necessary] for the sustenance<span class="linenum">960</span><a name="Line_960" id="Line_960"></a><br />
of this life. So, after their sin, they inhabited a more<br />
sorrowful land, a dwelling and country less fertile in<br />
every kind of blessing than their former abode had<br />
been, from which they had been driven out after their<br />
misdeed.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then they began, by God's command, to produce<span class="linenum">965</span><a name="Line_965" id="Line_965"></a><br />
children, as the Lord had charged them. To begin<br />
with, by Adam and Eve were brought into the world<br />
two fair first-born sons, Cain and Abel. The books<br />
tell us how these first toilers, loving brothers, gained<span class="linenum">970</span><a name="Line_970" id="Line_970"></a><br />
their subsistence, riches and food: the one who was<br />
elder born tilled the earth with his strength; the second<br />
kept the flocks, helping his father, until a great number<span class="linenum">975</span><a name="Line_975" id="Line_975"></a><br />
of days passed. They both brought an offering to the<br />
Lord: the Prince of the Angels, King of all things, looked<br />
upon Abel's offering with [favorable] eyes, but would<br />
not consider the sacrifice of Cain; that caused strong<br />
indignation in the heart of the man: rage arose in the<span class="linenum">980</span><a name="Line_980" id="Line_980"></a><br />
youth's breast, livid hatred, and wrath by reason of<br />
envy: then he wrought evil deeds with his hands, slew<br />
his kinsman, his own brother, shed his blood,&mdash;yea,<span class="linenum">985</span><a name="Line_985" id="Line_985"></a><br />
Cain [shed] Abel's. And the earth soaked up this blood<br />
shed by murder, the life-blood of a man.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
After this fatal blow woe was aroused, the long train<br />
of afflictions: since then from this twig have hatefully<br />
sprouted ever longer and stronger bitter branches: these<span class="linenum">990</span><a name="Line_990" id="Line_990"></a><br />
branches of calamity spread far and wide over the nations<br />
of men: hardly and sorely did the twigs of misery strike<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 151</span><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>
the sons of men (and so they still do), from which the<br />

tearfully lament this account, this death-bringing fatal-<br />

Our Ruler and glorious Lord set on him a sign, the<span class="linenum">1045</span><a name="Line_1045" id="Line_1045"></a><br />
Master [set] a symbol of immunity, so that none of his<br />
foes far or near might dare to approach him with warlike<br />
intent; then he bade the wicked one leave forever his<br />

out and departed sorrowing from before the face of God,<span class="linenum">1050</span><a name="Line_1050" id="Line_1050"></a><br />
a joyless exile, and built himself a dwelling to the east,<br />
a habitation far from his fatherland: there a fair maiden,<br />
a woman of the country, bore him offspring.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
The eldest was called Enos, first-born of Cain; he<span class="linenum">1055</span><a name="Line_1055" id="Line_1055"></a><br />

was the first beneath the clouds of all the fortifications<br />
which heroes and swordsmen have caused to be built.<span class="linenum">1060</span><a name="Line_1060" id="Line_1060"></a><br />
Therein his offspring first arose, born of his wife in the<br />

his kinsfolk, with his brothers, scion after scion, until<span class="linenum">1070</span><a name="Line_1070" id="Line_1070"></a><br />
wise through length of days he had to consummate<br />
his departure from the world and forsake life. After<br />

Sella, women of the country, bore offspring to him: of<br />
these one was Jabal by name, son of Lamech, who<br />
through skilful cunning first of dwellers here below<br />
awoke by his hands the song of the harp, that melo-<span class="linenum">1080</span><a name="Line_1080" id="Line_1080"></a><br />

Likewise, at this same time, there was in this family<br />
a man called Tubal Cain, a son of Lamech, who through<br />
the abundance of his skill was a master-smith, and first<span class="linenum">1085</span><a name="Line_1085" id="Line_1085"></a><br />
among men through the craft of his mind he was the<br />
inventor of agricultural implements upon earth: since<br />
then the sons of men dwelling in cities have known far<br />
and wide how to use brass and iron.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Once on a time Lamech himself made in words a wicked<span class="linenum">1090</span><a name="Line_1090" id="Line_1090"></a><br />
confession to his two wives, his dear bed-fellows, Ada<br />
and Sella:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;In murder I have slain a certain one among my near<br />
relations; I stained my hands with the gory death of<span class="linenum">1095</span><a name="Line_1095" id="Line_1095"></a><br />
Cain, destroyed with my hands the father of Enos, the<br />
slayer of Abel, and poured on the ground the life-blood<br />
of a man. Well knew I that for this shall come at last<br />
the sevenfold vengeance of the King of Truth, great<span class="linenum">1100</span><a name="Line_1100" id="Line_1100"></a><br />
according to the crime: my fall and destruction shall<br />
be more sternly meted out, with grim horror, when I<br />
depart!&quot;&mdash;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Now, there came to Adam in Abel's place another<span class="linenum">1105</span><a name="Line_1105" id="Line_1105"></a><br />
heir born in legal wedlock, an upright son, whose name<br />
was Seth: he was happy and contributed greatly to the<br />
comfort of his parents, Adam and Eve, his father and<br />
mother, and took Abel's place in worldly affairs.<span class="linenum">1110</span><a name="Line_1110" id="Line_1110"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the first of men spoke these words:<br />

my heart with this man-child: to Him be praise for this!&quot;<br />
When he began again to raise up another son to him-<br />
self by his wife, to be his heir, Adam the vigorous cham-<br />
pion had [numbered] 130 winters of this life in the world.<span class="linenum">1120</span><a name="Line_1120" id="Line_1120"></a><br />
The Scriptures tell us that on earth here for 800 years<br />
after that, Adam increased his family with maidens<br />

After him Seth ruled over the people,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> the son held<br />
the heritage after the parents, and took unto himself<span class="linenum">1130</span><a name="Line_1130" id="Line_1130"></a><br />
a wife: he counted 105 winters when he first began to<br />
increase the numbers of his family by sons and daughters.<br />
The eldest son of Seth was called Enos: he first of all<span class="linenum">1135</span><a name="Line_1135" id="Line_1135"></a><br />
the children of man called upon God,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> since Adam<br />
stepped upon the green grass, endowed with the spirit<br />

and daughters for 807 winters: in all he had 912, when<span class="linenum">1140</span><a name="Line_1140" id="Line_1140"></a><br />
the time was fulfilled that he should accomplish his<br />
departure.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
After him, when he departed out of the world, Enos<br />
held the heritage, after the earth had received the body<span class="linenum">1145</span><a name="Line_1145" id="Line_1145"></a><br />
of Seth, fruitful in the Lord. He was dear to God, and<br />
lived here 90 winters before he begot children here by<br />
his wife through intercourse: to him then was Cainan<br />
first born, an heir in his ancestral home. Afterwards<span class="linenum">1150</span><a name="Line_1150" id="Line_1150"></a><br />
for 815 winters<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> in the peace of God, the wise hero<br />
begot offspring, sons and daughters: he died, the sage<br />
patriarch, when he had [fulfilled] 905 [years].<br />

<p class="nowrap">
After Enos, Cainan was chieftain, keeper, and leader<span class="linenum">1155</span><a name="Line_1155" id="Line_1155"></a><br />
of his race: he had [numbered] 70 winters before a son<br />

had [lived] 910 winters, when he left this world, when<span class="linenum">1165</span><a name="Line_1165" id="Line_1165"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 155</span><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a>

many seasons. The chieftain had [lived] 65 winters,<span class="linenum">1170</span><a name="Line_1170" id="Line_1170"></a><br />
when he began to beget children by his wife. His wife<br />
brought a son to him, the woman to the man: this son<br />
in his childhood, as I have heard, the man-child in his<br />
youth, was called Jared. After this Malalehel lived<span class="linenum">1175</span><a name="Line_1175" id="Line_1175"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
After him for a long while Yeared dispensed gold to<br />
the people; the chieftain was noble, a pious hero, and a<br />

added descendants to the number of his race, for 800<span class="linenum">1190</span><a name="Line_1190" id="Line_1190"></a><br />
[years]: in all he had [counted] 965 [years] by night-<br />

for 300 winters; the Lord, the Ruler of the Skies, was<br />
gracious to him. From this world the hero sought in<br />
the body the joy and bliss of the Lord; in no wise did<span class="linenum">1205</span><a name="Line_1205" id="Line_1205"></a><br />

the pleasures of the world in this body: he begot a<br />
multitude of sons and daughters, before the day of his<br />
death. When he had to depart from among men, the<br />
venerable hero had [enjoyed] 970 winters.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
After him, his son Lamech held the government: for<span class="linenum">1225</span><a name="Line_1225" id="Line_1225"></a><br />
a long time thereafter he ruled over the world; he had<br />
[lived] 102 winters when the season came for the chief-<br />

<p class="nowrap">
After this the lord and chief of the people lived 595<span class="linenum">1230</span><a name="Line_1230" id="Line_1230"></a><br />

the race well, and begot children: youths and maidens<br />
arose as heirs to him. The eldest of them he named<br />
Noe, who reigned over the land among men after Lamech<span class="linenum">1235</span><a name="Line_1235" id="Line_1235"></a><br />

But when the sons of God began to seek brides among<br />
the race of Cain, the accursed folk, and chose wives<span class="linenum">1250</span><a name="Line_1250" id="Line_1250"></a><br />
from among them against the will of God, the children<br />
of men from among the sinful maidens, beautiful and<br />
bright, then the Ruler of the heavens pronounced his<br />
wrath against mankind and spoke these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;The men of Cain's race have not been absent from<span class="linenum">1255</span><a name="Line_1255" id="Line_1255"></a><br />
my mind, but that stock has sorely offended me. Now<br />
the sons of Seth renew my wrath and take to themselves<br />
the maidens of my enemies as wives: the fairness of the<span class="linenum">1260</span><a name="Line_1260" id="Line_1260"></a><br />
women, the maidens' faces, and the eternal Fiend have<br />
shamefully captivated the multitude of men who were<br />
formerly in peace.&quot;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
After that, for 120 winters, duly numbered, exile<br />
afflicted the accursed race in this world; then the Lord<span class="linenum">1265</span><a name="Line_1265" id="Line_1265"></a><br />
wished to inflict punishment upon the covenant-breakers,<br />
and to smite with death the doers of evil, the giant folk<br />
unloved by God, the great and sinful foes hateful to the<br />
Lord, when the Wielder of Victory himself saw what<span class="linenum">1270</span><a name="Line_1270" id="Line_1270"></a><br />
was man's wickedness on earth, and how they all were<br />
bold in crime and utterly vicious. He thought to<br />
punish rigorously the races of men, to seize upon the<span class="linenum">1275</span><a name="Line_1275" id="Line_1275"></a><br />
peoples grimly and sorely, with cruel might: he repented<br />
exceedingly that he had ever created the author of the<br />
nations, the source of the peoples, when he fashioned<br />
Adam. He said that on account of the sins of men he<br />
would utterly blot out all that there was on earth,<span class="linenum">1280</span><a name="Line_1280" id="Line_1280"></a><br />
destroy every one of the bodies in whose bosom the<br />
breath of life was concealed: all that came near to the<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Noe, the son of Lamech, just and honorable, was dear<span class="linenum">1285</span><a name="Line_1285" id="Line_1285"></a><br />

tector of all men, told him by revelation what he pur-<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 158</span><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>
posed inflicting upon the wicked ones: for he saw the<br />
earth full of unrighteousness, the broad plains laden<br />
with sin, polluted with foulness. Then spoke the Al-<span class="linenum">1295</span><a name="Line_1295" id="Line_1295"></a><br />
mighty, our Saviour, and said to Noe:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;I am resolved to destroy humanity by means of a<br />

but thou shalt have shelter, with thy sons, when the<span class="linenum">1300</span><a name="Line_1300" id="Line_1300"></a><br />
dark waters, the black floods of death, destroy mankind,<br />
the vile sinners. Begin to build thee a ship, a mighty<br />
sea-house, in which thou shalt give a place of refuge<br />
to many a one and a safe home to every species on earth,<span class="linenum">1305</span><a name="Line_1305" id="Line_1305"></a><br />
after thine own. Build partitions in the midst of the<br />
ship. Make the boat fifty cubits wide, thirty high,<br />
three hundred long, and joint it stoutly against the<span class="linenum">1310</span><a name="Line_1310" id="Line_1310"></a><br />
assault of the waves. There shall be a creature of every<br />
living species, a scion of every race on earth, led within<br />
that wooden fortress; so must the Ark be the greater!&quot;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Noe did as the Lord commanded him, obeyed the<span class="linenum">1315</span><a name="Line_1315" id="Line_1315"></a><br />
holy King of Heaven, began at once to build that Ark,<br />

punishment: but they heeded this not at all. Then,<span class="linenum">1320</span><a name="Line_1320" id="Line_1320"></a><br />
after several winters, the Changeless Lord saw that the<br />
vast sea-house, Noe's vessel, towered up in readiness,<br />
strengthened within and without with the best earth-<br />

seven [members] duly counted of each of the species that<br />

growing on earth used for food by the people who are<span class="linenum">1340</span><a name="Line_1340" id="Line_1340"></a><br />
to sail over the floods with thee. Feed freely the differ-<br />

thee for a good and true man: thou art worthy of<br />

Then Noe left him, as our Preserver commanded, in<br />
order to lead his children on board the Ark, men and their<br />

The waves of the King of Glory drove the souls of the<span class="linenum">1385</span><a name="Line_1385" id="Line_1385"></a><br />

the skies the foamy ship floated, from the time when<br />
the well-nailed sides of this best of boats first arose<br />
upon the flood until this number of days of dire time<span class="linenum">1420</span><a name="Line_1420" id="Line_1420"></a><br />
had passed. Then the Ark of Noe, greatest of ocean-<br />
homes, settled on high with its burden on the hills which<br />
are called Armenia: there the pious son of Lamech<span class="linenum">1425</span><a name="Line_1425" id="Line_1425"></a><br />
awaited the sure promises for a long time, when the<br />
Keeper of Life, the Almighty King, gave him relief from<br />
the perilous chances which he had long undergone,<br />
when the dark waves bore him abroad on the deep over<span class="linenum">1430</span><a name="Line_1430" id="Line_1430"></a><br />
far countries.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
The flood was sinking; the sea-farers, the heroes and<br />
their wives, longed [for the time] when they might<br />
venture to step out of their straitened quarters over the<br />
well-nailed side out on the bank, and take their goods<span class="linenum">1435</span><a name="Line_1435" id="Line_1435"></a><br />
out of their crowded home. So the guardian of the ship<br />
tried to find out whether the waters were still sinking<br />
under the clouds: accordingly, after many days from the<br />
time the high mountain-sides received the possessions<span class="linenum">1440</span><a name="Line_1440" id="Line_1440"></a><br />
and persons of the races of earth, the son of Lamech<br />
let a black raven fly out of the Ark over the high flood.<br />
Noe believed that if it found no land in its flight, it<span class="linenum">1445</span><a name="Line_1445" id="Line_1445"></a><br />
would zealously seek him again on the ship over the wide<br />
water. But this hope failed him; for the evil [bird]<br />
alighted upon a floating corpse: the dark-feathered fowl<br />
would not seek [further]. Then again after a week he sent<br />
from the Ark a purple dove to fly over the high water<span class="linenum">1450</span><a name="Line_1450" id="Line_1450"></a><br />
after the dark raven, for the purpose of finding out<br />
whether the foamy sea, the ocean, had given up any<br />
portion of the green earth, as yet. Widely she sought<span class="linenum">1455</span><a name="Line_1455" id="Line_1455"></a><br />
her desired object, and flew afar: nowhere did she find<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 162</span><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>
a resting-place, since she could not settle on land on foot<br />
because of the flood, nor alight on a leaf of a tree<br />
because of the waves; for the steep mountain-sides were<span class="linenum">1460</span><a name="Line_1460" id="Line_1460"></a><br />
hidden by the waters. The wild bird set out in the<br />
evening to seek the Ark over the dusky flood, and sank<br />
weary and famished in the hands of the pious hero.<br />
Then after a week the wild-dove was again sent out<span class="linenum">1465</span><a name="Line_1465" id="Line_1465"></a><br />
from the Ark: she flew far, until greatly rejoicing she<br />
found a fair place for rest and settled with her feet on<br />
a tree; she exulted glad at heart, because exceedingly<br />
weary [as she was] she could sit in the bright branches<span class="linenum">1470</span><a name="Line_1470" id="Line_1470"></a><br />
of a tree: she shook out her wings and started to fly<br />
back again with her gift, [for she] brought in her flight<br />
an olive twig, green leaves, into the hands of one [on<br />
board]. Then quickly the leader of the voyagers per-<span class="linenum">1475</span><a name="Line_1475" id="Line_1475"></a><br />
ceived that solace had come, relief from their perilous<br />
experience. So again after a third week the happy<br />
man sent out a wild dove; it did not come flying back<br />
to the ship, for it found land, green groves: the glad<span class="linenum">1480</span><a name="Line_1480" id="Line_1480"></a><br />
creature did not wish to show itself ever again under the<br />
pitch-smeared roof on the Ark, when there was no need.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then to Noe spoke our Preserver, Ruler of Heaven,<br />
with holy voice:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;For you is a dwelling-place again appointed, fair<span class="linenum">1485</span><a name="Line_1485" id="Line_1485"></a><br />
on the dry land, joys on earth and rest after your voyage.<br />
Depart in peace out of the Ark, and lead forth upon the<br />
bosom of the earth out of this lofty structure your com-<br />
panions and all the creatures which I mercifully preserved<span class="linenum">1490</span><a name="Line_1490" id="Line_1490"></a><br />
from the peril of the flood, while the deluge held sway<br />
[and] covered your home with its abundance.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
He did so, and obeyed the Lord, stood forth upon the<br />
strand, as the Voice bade him, and with great joy led<span class="linenum">1495</span><a name="Line_1495" id="Line_1495"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 163</span><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>
out of the ship the survivors of these perils.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Noe began to institute a sacrifice to our Preserver,<br />
and immediately took a part of all his possessions which<br />
the Lord had given to him for his comfort, and then,<span class="linenum">1500</span><a name="Line_1500" id="Line_1500"></a><br />
zealous for the offering, even to God Himself, King of<br />
the Angels, the clear-souled man proffered the sacrifice.<br />
Certainly our Saviour let it be known, when he blessed<span class="linenum">1505</span><a name="Line_1505" id="Line_1505"></a><br />
Noe and his sons too, that [the patriarch] had given Him<br />
this offering acceptably and in his youth had merited<br />
by his good deeds that Almighty God, Glorious in<br />
Splendor, should be gracious to him with all blessings.<span class="linenum">1510</span><a name="Line_1510" id="Line_1510"></a><br />
Then again the Lord, Ruler of Glory, spoke a word to<br />
Noe:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Increase now and multiply, enjoy your honor, with<br />
the gladness of peace: fill the earth, make all things teem.<br />
Into your possession is given a noble heritage, the produce<span class="linenum">1515</span><a name="Line_1515" id="Line_1515"></a><br />
of the sea, the fowls of heaven, and the wild beasts,&mdash;<br />
the verdant earth and every treasure. You shall<br />
never dishonorably procure your food through bloodshed,<span class="linenum">1520</span><a name="Line_1520" id="Line_1520"></a><br />
sinfully stricken in its life-blood. Each one first of all<br />
injures himself in the riches of the spirit, who with the<br />
edge of the sword takes the life of another: nor shall<br />
he dare to rejoice in thought over the spoils, for I will<br />
avenge a man's death all the more severely upon the<span class="linenum">1525</span><a name="Line_1525" id="Line_1525"></a><br />
slayer and upon the fratricide, in proportion as blood-<br />
shed, the slaughter of a man with weapons, or murder by<br />
[violent] hands, seems to succeed. Man was first created<br />
in the likeness of God: every man has the form of the<span class="linenum">1530</span><a name="Line_1530" id="Line_1530"></a><br />
Lord and of the Angels, whose virtues follow my holy<br />
will. Increase and multiply, enjoy riches and honor on<br />
earth. Fill the countries of the world with people, your<br />
offspring, sons and daughters. I will set up for you this<span class="linenum">1535</span><a name="Line_1535" id="Line_1535"></a><br />
my pledge, that I will never again let loose the floods<br />
upon the earth, the waters over the broad lands: you<br />
may see this witness frequently upon the clouds, when<span class="linenum">1540</span><a name="Line_1540" id="Line_1540"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 164</span><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>
I show my rainbow, [as proof] that I will certainly keep<br />
this bond with men, while the world lasts.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Thus was the prudent son of Lamech, the keeper of<br />
the heritage, disembarked from his ship after the flood<span class="linenum">1545</span><a name="Line_1545" id="Line_1545"></a><br />
with his three sons; and their four wives were named<br />
Percoba, Olla, Olliva, and Ollivani,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> saved from the<br />
waters by the true God. The stout-minded heroes,<span class="linenum">1550</span><a name="Line_1550" id="Line_1550"></a><br />
the sons of Noe, were called Sem and Cham, and the third<br />
Iafeth: from these warriors the nations sprang and all<br />
this earth was filled with the children of men.<br />
</p>
<h3>
  XIX.
</h3>
<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Then for the second time Noe began to establish his<span class="linenum">1555</span><a name="Line_1555" id="Line_1555"></a><br />
home, with his kinsfolk, and to till the earth for food;<br />
he struggled and toiled, planted a vineyard, sowed many<br />
seeds and tended them carefully, so that the green<span class="linenum">1560</span><a name="Line_1560" id="Line_1560"></a><br />
earth, with its fertile boon, brought him fair harvests.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then it befell once that the blessed man was in his<br />
dwelling, drunken with wine; weary of feasting he slept,<br />
and thrust the robe from his body, as was not fitting, and<span class="linenum">1565</span><a name="Line_1565" id="Line_1565"></a><br />
lay there with naked limbs: little he noticed that it went<br />
so ill with him in his hall, when intoxication in his breast<br />
gripped his heart in the holy house. In this torpor his<span class="linenum">1570</span><a name="Line_1570" id="Line_1570"></a><br />
intelligence was cruelly crippled, so that he could not<br />
call to mind [the necessity for] covering himself with his<br />
clothing and concealing his nakedness, as was ordained<br />
for men and women, ever since the minister of Glory<span class="linenum">1575</span><a name="Line_1575" id="Line_1575"></a><br />
locked the native abode of life behind our [first father]<br />
and mother, with a fiery sword. Now Cam, the son<br />
of Noe, chanced to come in where his father lay bereft<br />
of consciousness: thereupon would he dutifully no honor<span class="linenum">1580</span><a name="Line_1580" id="Line_1580"></a><br />
show to his own father nor at least conceal the dis-<br />
grace from his kinsmen; but laughing aloud he told<br />
his brothers how the patriarch rested in the house.<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 165</span><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>
They repaired thither speedily, their faces carefully<span class="linenum">1585</span><a name="Line_1585" id="Line_1585"></a><br />
veiled under cloaks, so that they bore aid to the dear<br />
man: they were both good men, Sem and Iafeth.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the son of Lamech awoke from his sleep and<br />
soon perceived that Cham would not show him, the nobly<span class="linenum">1590</span><a name="Line_1590" id="Line_1590"></a><br />
born, any affection and duty, when honor was due him.<br />
That was bitter to the heart of the holy man, and he<br />
began to curse his son with [harsh] words: he said that<br />
Ham should be humbled under the heavens, the servant<span class="linenum">1595</span><a name="Line_1595" id="Line_1595"></a><br />
of his kinsfolk on earth: on him and his race those<br />
baneful words have fallen heavily, ever since. Then<br />
Noe enjoyed his broad heritage with his sons, free men,<br />
for 350 winters of this life after the flood: then he passed<span class="linenum">1600</span><a name="Line_1600" id="Line_1600"></a><br />
away.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
After that his sons dispensed the treasures: they<br />
begot children: great was their wealth. Thus to Iafeth<br />
was progeny born, a pleasing family of promising young<span class="linenum">1605</span><a name="Line_1605" id="Line_1605"></a><br />
ones, sons and daughters. He was a good man [and]<br />
ever prosperously held his patrimony, [sharing his]<br />
abundance with his children, until the treasure of his<br />
breast, his spirit longing for release, was summoned to<span class="linenum">1610</span><a name="Line_1610" id="Line_1610"></a><br />
the judgment of God: thereupon Geomor, Iafeth's son,<br />
shared his father's property with his friends, dear ones,<br />
and relatives; with his descendants was filled by genera-<br />
tion no small portion of the earth.&mdash;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Sons of Cham were born, likewise, heirs for the pa-<span class="linenum">1615</span><a name="Line_1615" id="Line_1615"></a><br />
trimony: the eldest were called Chus and Cham, very<br />
noble of soul, the first-born of Cham. Chus was the<br />
chief of the leaders, dispenser of treasure and worldly<span class="linenum">1620</span><a name="Line_1620" id="Line_1620"></a><br />
riches to his brothers, the private property of his father,<br />
after Cham fared forth from the body when death fell<br />
to his lot. This leader of the people delivered judgments<span class="linenum">1625</span><a name="Line_1625" id="Line_1625"></a><br />
for his race until the number of his days had run: then<br />
the hero yielded up this world's goods and sought another<br />
life. After that, the son of Chus, first-born of the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 166</span><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>
brothers, ruled the paternal<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> heritage, a widely known<span class="linenum">1630</span><a name="Line_1630" id="Line_1630"></a><br />
man. So the Scriptures tell us, that he had the greatest<br />
might and strength of all mankind, in those days: he<br />
was a prince of the Babylonian Empire, and first of the<br />
nobles raised, spread, and exalted its fame. At that<span class="linenum">1635</span><a name="Line_1635" id="Line_1635"></a><br />
time one tongue was still common to all dwellers on<br />
earth.<br />
</p>
<h3>

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Likewise from Cam's stock sprang many descendants,<br />
and to these numerous people great families were born.&mdash;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Furthermore many sons and daughters were born into<span class="linenum">1640</span><a name="Line_1640" id="Line_1640"></a><br />
the world to Sem, noble folk, before the ruler of men<br />
took to his death-bed, in the course of years. In this<br />
family were good men, of whom one was called Eber, a<span class="linenum">1645</span><a name="Line_1645" id="Line_1645"></a><br />
son of Sem: from this chief sprang a multitude of people,<br />
whom all nations and earth-dwellers now call Hebrews.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
They set out then to take their posssesions from the<br />
eastward, live-stock and treasure; the people were un-<span class="linenum">1650</span><a name="Line_1650" id="Line_1650"></a><br />
animous: the vigorous heroes sought a less crowded land,<br />
until the migrating folk in great multitudes came where<br />
their noble leaders firmly took possession. The rulers<span class="linenum">1655</span><a name="Line_1655" id="Line_1655"></a><br />
of the people settled with their dear followers in Sennar,<br />
ample and broad; in the years of their life the fields<br />
were ever verdant and the earth fair for the people at<br />
that time, with increasing abundance of each [kind of]<span class="linenum">1661</span><a name="Line_1661" id="Line_1661"></a><br />
treasure.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then many a man argued with his dear friend, one<br />
resolute hero with another, that for their greater glory,<br />
before the masses of the people should scatter again over<span class="linenum">1665</span><a name="Line_1665" id="Line_1665"></a><br />
the earth, numbers of the nation in search of land, they<br />
should build a city and raise up a tower to the stars of<br />
heaven as a sign that they had sought Sennar fields because<br />
the mighty fore-fathers of the race, the patriarchs, long<span class="linenum">1670</span><a name="Line_1670" id="Line_1670"></a><br />
lived there with pleasure: with craft the people wrought,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 167</span><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>
in labor and industry, until in arrogance and rashness they<br />
showed their skill, built a fortress and raised aloft scaling-<span class="linenum">1675</span><a name="Line_1675" id="Line_1675"></a><br />
ladders towards heaven, mightily erected a solid stone wall<br />
beyond man's measure, eager for glory:&mdash;[all this did] the<br />
heroes with their hands. Then Holy God came to inspect<br />
the work of the race of men, the fortress of the warriors,<span class="linenum">1680</span><a name="Line_1680" id="Line_1680"></a><br />
and that beacon-tower likewise which the sons of Adam<br />
began to rear up to the skies; and the steadfast King<br />
achieved the prevention of this evil design, when in<br />
wrath he distributed different languages among the<span class="linenum">1685</span><a name="Line_1685" id="Line_1685"></a><br />
inhabitants of earth, so that they no longer had control<br />
of their speech. They found then multitudes at the<br />
tower with victorious strength, leaders of work in vast<br />
battalions: but not one of the tribes understood what<span class="linenum">1690</span><a name="Line_1690" id="Line_1690"></a><br />
another was saying. It could not be, that they should<br />
build up the stone wall further; but they wretchedly<br />
parted in bands separated by their speech: one had<br />
become to another a strange race, after the Lord by the<span class="linenum">1695</span><a name="Line_1695" id="Line_1695"></a><br />
fullness of his might had confused the speech of men.<br />
The disunited sons of the patriarchs then parted in<br />
four directions to seek land: behind them, both the<span class="linenum">1700</span><a name="Line_1700" id="Line_1700"></a><br />
mighty tower of stone and the lofty city stood on Sennar<br />
[plain] together, half-finished.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the race of Sem increased and multiplied under<br />
the clouds, until a man arose in the number of that<br />
kingly people, a sagacious man, prudent in habit. To<span class="linenum">1705</span><a name="Line_1705" id="Line_1705"></a><br />
this nobleman sons were born, two free children were<br />
born in Babylon, and these chieftains, strong-minded<br />
heroes, were called Abraham and Aaron. The Sovereign<span class="linenum">1710</span><a name="Line_1710" id="Line_1710"></a><br />
of the Angels was friend and guide to both these leaders.<br />
Then to Aaron was born a son, upright in life, whose<br />
name was Loth. Thereafter the righteous heroes,<br />
Abraham and Loth, throve nobly in the Lord's sight, as<span class="linenum">1715</span><a name="Line_1715" id="Line_1715"></a><br />
the inheritance in the kingdom came to them from their<br />
parents; therefore they widely glorified the sons of men<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 168</span><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>
with gifts.<br />
</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Now the period of time had come when Abraham<span class="linenum">1720</span><a name="Line_1720" id="Line_1720"></a><br />
brought a wife, a fair and free-born bride to his house,<br />
where he possessed a dwelling: the woman was named<br />
Sarra, as the books tell us. They enjoyed life thus for<br />
many winters, held the property together in peace for<span class="linenum">1725</span><a name="Line_1725" id="Line_1725"></a><br />
many years. But it was not vouchsafed to Abraham<br />
as yet that his bright-faced bride should bring into the<br />
world a guardian for his heritage, that Sarra [should<br />
bear] sons and daughters to Abraham.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham's father set out with his family and<span class="linenum">1730</span><a name="Line_1730" id="Line_1730"></a><br />
[all] his substance to pass through the Caldean country:<br />
he wisely wished to seek the land of Canan, with his<br />
household. The cousins chosen by the Lord, Abraham<br />
and Loth, went with him out of their heritage. Then<span class="linenum">1735</span><a name="Line_1735" id="Line_1735"></a><br />
the nobly-born sons of the patriarchs took up their<br />
dwelling in Carran, the men with their wives. In his<br />
home here Abraham's father departed this life, the<span class="linenum">1740</span><a name="Line_1740" id="Line_1740"></a><br />
steadfast worthy: he had told 205 winters, in all, when<br />
he fared forth ripe in years to meet his fate.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the holy Guardian of the heavenly kingdom, the<span class="linenum">1745</span><a name="Line_1745" id="Line_1745"></a><br />
Eternal Lord, spoke to Abraham:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Set forth now, and take thy movable possessions and<br />
fertile herds with thee. Give up Carran, thy father's<br />
dwelling-place. Depart, as I bid thee, O dearest of<br />
men, and heed well my instructions, and seek the land<span class="linenum">1750</span><a name="Line_1750" id="Line_1750"></a><br />
which I shall show thee, a broad verdant country. Thou<br />
shalt live blessed under my protection: if any of the<br />
dwellers on earth greet thee with evil, I will set upon<span class="linenum">1755</span><a name="Line_1755" id="Line_1755"></a><br />
them my curse and my hatred, long-lasting affliction;<br />
and I shall give favors, abundance of blessings, to those<br />
who treat thee well. Through thee shall all earth-<br />
dwellers, sons of man, receive peace and friendship,<span class="linenum">1760</span><a name="Line_1760" id="Line_1760"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 169</span><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>
my grace and blessing, in this world. Far spreading<br />
under the sun shall be the number of thy race by [the<br />
birth of] sons and daughters, until many a region of the<span class="linenum">1765</span><a name="Line_1765" id="Line_1765"></a><br />
earth shall be filled with thy progeny.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham, pre&euml;minently upright, rich, and blessed<br />
with gold and silver, set out to take his flocks and<br />
possessions from Carran into the country of Egipt, as<span class="linenum">1770</span><a name="Line_1770" id="Line_1770"></a><br />
the Warder of Victory, our Ruler, bade him through his<br />
Word: they sought the land and nation of Canan. Thus<br />
the man dear to God came to lead his wife, his dear bed-<span class="linenum">1775</span><a name="Line_1775" id="Line_1775"></a><br />
fellow, and his nephew's wife, into this inheritance, into<br />
happiness. He had [numbered] 75 winters when he<br />
had to fare forth, to give up Carran and his kinsfolk.<br />
So Abraham set out, mindful of the instructions of the<span class="linenum">1780</span><a name="Line_1780" id="Line_1780"></a><br />
Father Almighty, to look for the broad land beyond<br />
these nations, at his Lord's command, until prospering<br />
in his journey the courageous man came to Siem, of the<br />
Cananite race. Then the Lord and King of the Angels,<br />
Sovereign of men, manifested himself to Abraham and<span class="linenum">1785</span><a name="Line_1785" id="Line_1785"></a><br />
said:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">

Then the good man built an altar and offered sacrifice<br />
to the Ruler of Life and Source of Light, the Protector<br />

the east in order to search with his eyes for the choicest<span class="linenum">1795</span><a name="Line_1795" id="Line_1795"></a><br />
of lands (he remembered the favors, God's promises,<br />

There Abraham for the second time built an altar:<br />
there he called upon God with noble words, and offered<br />
sacrifice to the Lord of his life. Not at all sparingly<br />
did God, through His own hand, give him reward for<br />
this,&mdash;rich bounty, in the very place of sacrifice.<span class="linenum">1810</span><a name="Line_1810" id="Line_1810"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
There for a while the wise leader dwelt in his home<br />
and enjoyed happiness, the hero with his bride, until a<br />
frightful calamity began to press upon the Cananite<br />
race, cruel hunger, deadly to home-staying men. Then<span class="linenum">1815</span><a name="Line_1815" id="Line_1815"></a><br />
the wise Abraham, chosen by the Lord, went into Egypt<br />
to seek sustenance; the sage fled before evil: the plague<br />
was too strong. Abraham spoke,&mdash;for he saw the white<span class="linenum">1820</span><a name="Line_1820" id="Line_1820"></a><br />
pinnacled halls of Egypt and the tall cities shining<br />
brightly,&mdash;and then the ruler, the sagacious man, began<br />
to instruct his wife, in these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;When many haughty Egyptians shall gaze with<br />
their eyes upon thy countenance, then should the nobly-<span class="linenum">1825</span><a name="Line_1825" id="Line_1825"></a><br />
born chieftains suppose, O woman fair as a goddess, that<br />
thou art my bright bed-fellow whom some one of the<br />
warriors will wish to have for himself, then I may well<br />
fear for myself lest some one of my foes may deprive<span class="linenum">1830</span><a name="Line_1830" id="Line_1830"></a><br />
me of life with the edge of his sword by reason of his<br />
amorous desire. Say then, Sarra, that thou art my<br />
sister, my blood-relation, when the strange men ask<br />
thee what degree of familiarity may exist between us<span class="linenum">1835</span><a name="Line_1835" id="Line_1835"></a><br />
two foreigners, who come from so far away: hold fast<br />
true speech from them, and thus thou shalt preserve<br />
my life,&mdash;if the Lord of Peace, our Almighty Ruler,<br />
grant me longer life in this world, as he did before, who<span class="linenum">1840</span><a name="Line_1840" id="Line_1840"></a><br />
ordained these travels for us in order that we might seek<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 171</span><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>
aid and secure sustenance for ourselves in Egipt.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Thereupon Abraham, the vigorous leader, proceeded<span class="linenum">1845</span><a name="Line_1845" id="Line_1845"></a><br />
with his possessions into Egypt, where the people were<br />
strange to him, and friends unknown. Many haughty<br />
men spoke of the beauty of his wife in their remarks,<br />
men distinguished by their wealth: to many high-spirited<span class="linenum">1850</span><a name="Line_1850" id="Line_1850"></a><br />
men, vassals of the king, his wife seemed noble in counte-<br />
nance. They brought the news to their liege-lord, and<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><br />
few women did they repute fairer before the king, but<br />
they lauded exceedingly Sarra's countenance for its<span class="linenum">1855</span><a name="Line_1855" id="Line_1855"></a><br />
great beauty, until he bade them bring the lovely woman<br />
to his own hall. The ruler of the people and chief of<br />
the nobles bade them enrich Abraham with treasures.<br />
But the Lord God became aggrieved and incensed against<span class="linenum">1860</span><a name="Line_1860" id="Line_1860"></a><br />
Farao for his love of the woman: the joy of his house-<br />
hold<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> bore this wrath hardly with his intimates. How-<br />
ever, the ruler of the people perceived what the Lord<br />
was sending upon him for punishment: urged on by<span class="linenum">1865</span><a name="Line_1865" id="Line_1865"></a><br />
fear, the king of Egipt called Abraham to him and gave<br />
him his bride, [returned] his wife into his keeping, bade<br />
him seek friends elsewhere, noblemen of another race.<br />
Then the ruler of the country ordered his vassals and<span class="linenum">1870</span><a name="Line_1870" id="Line_1870"></a><br />
ministers to escort him out of their land again, honor-<br />
ably, uninjured in any respect, so that he might be in<br />
peace.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham took [all his] possessions out of the<br />
country of Egypt: these worthy heroes took their wives,<span class="linenum">1875</span><a name="Line_1875" id="Line_1875"></a><br />
both brides and rings, while they brought their flocks<br />
to Bethlem, a familiar dwelling-place, [brought] their<br />
womenfolk and treasures and their worldly goods.<span class="linenum">1880</span><a name="Line_1880" id="Line_1880"></a><br />
Then they began to build there, and to erect their city<br />
and settle their homes, and renew their prosperity.<br />
The men built an altar in the meadows near the one that<br />
Abraham had formerly reared to his Lord, when he<br />
came to this western land: there the fortunate man<span class="linenum">1885</span><a name="Line_1885" id="Line_1885"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 172</span><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>
exalted the Name of the Eternal Lord once more; the<br />
high-minded ruler offered sacrifice to the King of the<br />
Angels, thanked exceedingly the Source of Light and<br />
Life for his happiness and honor.<br />

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Abraham and Loth lived in these dwellings and had<span class="linenum">1890</span><a name="Line_1890" id="Line_1890"></a><br />
abundance of prosperity, ruled over their heritage, until<br />
they could not enjoy plenty together any longer in that<br />
land and keep the possessions of both there, but the<br />
worthy warriors had to seek broader seats elsewhere.<span class="linenum">1895</span><a name="Line_1895" id="Line_1895"></a><br />
There were often dissensions among the followers of the<br />
steadfast heroes, quarrels among the herdsmen. Then<br />
the blessed Abraham, mindful of their honor, began to<br />
speak fairly to Loth:<span class="linenum">1900</span><a name="Line_1900" id="Line_1900"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;I am thy father's born brother, thou art my nephew;<br />
quarrels shall not wax great between us, nor anger<br />
grow: may God forbid that! But we are blood-re-<br />
lations: between us shall nothing be except, most fit-<span class="linenum">1905</span><a name="Line_1905" id="Line_1905"></a><br />
tingly, long-enduring love. Now bethink thee, Loth,<br />
that about our borders dwell mighty men, powerful<br />
peoples with lords and vassals, the Cananite and Feretite<br />
nations, with energetic warriors: their landed property<span class="linenum">1910</span><a name="Line_1910" id="Line_1910"></a><br />
will not make any more room for us. Therefore shall<br />
we remove our differences from this place and seek<br />
broader dwelling-places for ourselves: I speak what is<br />
best for us both, son of Aron, a true saying. I leave<span class="linenum">1915</span><a name="Line_1915" id="Line_1915"></a><br />
the choice to thee, dear friend. Ponder with thyself<br />
and consider in thy heart in which direction thou wilt<br />
take thy departure, go forth with thy herds: now I have<br />
yielded thee the choice!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Loth left him to seek land by the Iordan, fertile<span class="linenum">1920</span><a name="Line_1920" id="Line_1920"></a><br />
country: it was refreshed with waters and enriched with<br />
fruits, bright with rivers, and like to the earthly par-<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 173</span><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>
adise of God, until God the Saviour because of men's<span class="linenum">1925</span><a name="Line_1925" id="Line_1925"></a><br />
sins gave Sodoma and Gomorra to destruction, to the<br />
dark flames. So the son of Aron chose his dwelling-<br />
place there, a settlement in the city of Sodoma, and<br />
brought<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> thither all his possessions, rings and private<span class="linenum">1930</span><a name="Line_1930" id="Line_1930"></a><br />
property from Bethlem, goods, and wrought gold. For<br />
many years thereafter he dwelt by the Iordan: fair<br />
dwelling-places were there, but vicious men also, hateful<br />
to the Lord. The people of Sodoma were bold in sin,<span class="linenum">1935</span><a name="Line_1935" id="Line_1935"></a><br />
shameful in their deeds: they brought upon themselves<br />
eternal woe. Loth would never adopt the customs of<br />
the country, but he always eschewed the habits of this<br />
people, [their] evil and sin, even though he had to live<span class="linenum">1940</span><a name="Line_1940" id="Line_1940"></a><br />
in their land, and kept himself pure, virtuous, and pa-<br />
tient, even in this nation, just as if&mdash;mindful of [his<br />
Lord's] teaching&mdash;he did not know what these people<br />
were doing.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Abraham dwelt by the habitations of the Cananites:<span class="linenum">1945</span><a name="Line_1945" id="Line_1945"></a><br />
the King of the Angels, Lord of mankind, held him under<br />
his protection, with abundance of good things and<br />
worldly treasures, love and joy; therefore the races of<span class="linenum">1950</span><a name="Line_1950" id="Line_1950"></a><br />
men, children of baptism, sing his praise widely under<br />
the clouds. Pious and prudent, he freely obeyed the<br />
Lord in his land as long as he enjoyed the heritage:<br />
never need a defenceless human being ever become in<br />
any way a terrified and fearful man before the Lord,<span class="linenum">1955</span><a name="Line_1955" id="Line_1955"></a><br />
if he will always, until his departure from life, thank<br />
Him heedfully in speech and in heart, by word and deed,<br />
with wise mind after every favor.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a><br />

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I found that the king of the Elamites, Orlahomar,<span class="linenum">1960</span><a name="Line_1960" id="Line_1960"></a><br />
a pious leader, made an expedition: in aid of him Am-<br />
brafel set forth from Sennar with a great multitude.<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 174</span><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>
Four kings then set out with mighty power to seek<span class="linenum">1965</span><a name="Line_1965" id="Line_1965"></a><br />
Sodoma and Gomorra, southward from there. Then was<br />
the country of the men by Iordan widely besieged by<br />
warriors, the land [was surrounded] by foes. Many<br />
a terrified pale-cheeked maiden would have to go trem-<span class="linenum">1970</span><a name="Line_1970" id="Line_1970"></a><br />
bling to the embrace of a stranger: the defenders of<br />
the brides and rings would fall, weak with wounds.<br />
Against them with warlike zeal five kings came forth<span class="linenum">1975</span><a name="Line_1975" id="Line_1975"></a><br />
from the south, with their armies, who wished to rid<br />
the city of Sodoma of its foes: for twelve winters before<br />
of necessity they had had to yield tribute and pay<br />
indemnity to the men of the north, until the people<br />
no longer would enrich the king of the Elamites with<span class="linenum">1980</span><a name="Line_1980" id="Line_1980"></a><br />
their own treasures, but revolted from him.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
In rage the slaughter-hordes came together: the jav-<br />
elins were loud; the dark fowl sang among the flying<br />
weapons, the dewy-feathered [raven] looked for the slain.<span class="linenum">1985</span><a name="Line_1985" id="Line_1985"></a><br />
The warriors rushed on in cohorts with unfaltering cour-<br />
age, until the nations' armies had come together widely,<br />
from south and north, protected by their helmets. There<br />
was bitter struggle, exchanges of deadly spears, great<span class="linenum">1990</span><a name="Line_1990" id="Line_1990"></a><br />
tumult of war, loud din of conflict. The heroes drew<br />
from the sheath with their hands the ring-mailed sword,<br />
keen of edge. Then was booty easy to find for the<br />
chieftain who before this was not readily sated with<span class="linenum">1995</span><a name="Line_1995" id="Line_1995"></a><br />
battle! The northern men were fatal to the southern<br />
men: the men of Sodoma and Gomorra, dispensers of<br />
gold, were bereft of their dear allies at the shield-clash-<br />
ing. They went forth from their homesteads to save<span class="linenum">2000</span><a name="Line_2000" id="Line_2000"></a><br />
themselves by flight; behind them the youths of the race<br />
fell, slain by the sword, [and] their allies [were] cleft with<br />
the edge. The leader of the army of the Elamites had<span class="linenum">2005</span><a name="Line_2005" id="Line_2005"></a><br />
victory in battle, was master of the battlefield. The<br />
survivors of the weapons fled to seek fastnesses. The<br />
enemy seized upon gold, robbed with devastation the<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 175</span><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>
treasure-cities of the people, Sodoma and Gomorra. Then<br />
misery requited the great strongholds; the maidens,<span class="linenum">2010</span><a name="Line_2010" id="Line_2010"></a><br />
wives, and widows, deprived of friends, departed from<br />
their homesteads. The enemy led out with them from<br />
the city of Sodoma, with their spoils, the kinsman of<br />
Abraham.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
We may now relate this true history further, as to<br />
what was the fate of the war-wolves after the battle,<span class="linenum">2015</span><a name="Line_2015" id="Line_2015"></a><br />
who carried off Loth and the goods of the people, the<br />
treasures of the southlanders, [and] exulted in victory.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
A warrior, a survivor of the sword who was spared<br />
in battle, escaped from them suddenly, to seek Abraham:<span class="linenum">2020</span><a name="Line_2020" id="Line_2020"></a><br />
he reported to the Ebrew chieftain the outcome of the<br />
fray,&mdash;the people of Sodoma sorely stricken, the nation's<br />
wealth, and Loth's situation. Thereupon Abraham re-<br />
ported the evil tidings to his friends; the steadfast hero<span class="linenum">2025</span><a name="Line_2025" id="Line_2025"></a><br />
requested aid of his favorite companions, Aner, Mamre,<br />
and thirdly Escol, saying that it would be gall to his<br />
heart and bitterest grief if his nephew should have to<span class="linenum">2030</span><a name="Line_2030" id="Line_2030"></a><br />
suffer slavery: bade the warriors famed in battle think of<br />
some plan so that his dear kinsman might be freed, the<br />
hero with his bride. In reply the three brothers, famed<br />
in war, with great readiness assuaged his grief by their<span class="linenum">2035</span><a name="Line_2035" id="Line_2035"></a><br />
hardy words, and pledged their troth to Abraham that<br />
they would avenge his injury upon his foes, with him,<br />
or else fall in battle.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the holy man bade his companions take their<span class="linenum">2040</span><a name="Line_2040" id="Line_2040"></a><br />
weapons: he found there 318 spear-bearing warriors,<br />
loyal to their ruler, of whom he knew that every one<br />
could well support the tawny linden-shield in an onset.<span class="linenum">2045</span><a name="Line_2045" id="Line_2045"></a><br />
So Abraham set out with the three chieftains who had<br />
just pledged their troth to him, and the band of their<br />
followers. He wished to rescue his kinsman at least,<br />
Loth, from suffering.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> These warriors were famous:<br />
they bore their shields forth boldly on the march. The<span class="linenum">2050</span><a name="Line_2050" id="Line_2050"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 176</span><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>
war-wolves, [meanwhile], had nearly reached their<br />
camping-place: then the prudent man, the son of Thare,<br />
spoke to his war-leaders in these words, (great was his<br />
need!), that they<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> should advance on the enemy in two<span class="linenum">2055</span><a name="Line_2055" id="Line_2055"></a><br />
divisions with grim conflict and hard swordplay: said,<br />
[further], that the Holy Lord Everlasting might easily<br />
give him success in the spear-fight.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I heard how under the cover of night the heroes<span class="linenum">2060</span><a name="Line_2060" id="Line_2060"></a><br />
ventured on into battle: the din of shields and shafts<br />
arose in their sleeping-quarters, the slaughter of archers<br />
and impact of battle-arrows; sharp swords smote hate-<br />
fully under the breast of men, and the bodies of foes<span class="linenum">2065</span><a name="Line_2065" id="Line_2065"></a><br />
fell thickly, where the exulting heroes and comrades<br />
were bringing together the spoil. Victory, men's glory<br />
in war, turned aside again from the battle of the north-<br />
men. Abraham gave armed conflict and not in any<span class="linenum">2070</span><a name="Line_2070" id="Line_2070"></a><br />
wise wrought gold, as ransom for his nephew; he slew<br />
and felled the enemy in fair fight: to aid him, the Guard-<br />
ian of the heavenly kingdom took [a part in the fray].<br />
The four armies were put to flight, [with] the kings and<br />
leaders of the people: behind them pressed the joyful<span class="linenum">2075</span><a name="Line_2075" id="Line_2075"></a><br />
band and [there] the heroes were slain; the others were<br />
given over to flight,&mdash;those who had stolen the gold of<br />
Sodom and Gomorra, and robbed the stewards: fiercely did<span class="linenum">2080</span><a name="Line_2080" id="Line_2080"></a><br />
the uncle of Loth requite them for it. The noble leaders<br />
of the Elamites were fleeing, bereft of power, until they<br />
were not far from Domascus. Then Abraham set out on<span class="linenum">2085</span><a name="Line_2085" id="Line_2085"></a><br />
the war-track to see the retreat of the wicked men. Lot<br />
was freed, the chieftain with his possessions, [while] the<br />
women [and] wives were restored to joy. Far and wide<br />
they saw the birds of prey rending the murderers of free-<br />
men in sword-slaughter. Abraham brought back again<span class="linenum">2090</span><a name="Line_2090" id="Line_2090"></a><br />
the treasure and brides of the southlanders, the children<br />
of the nobles nearer their homes, the maidens to their<br />
families. Of all men living here [on earth], no one ever<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 177</span><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
achieved a more worthy military expedition with a<span class="linenum">2095</span><a name="Line_2095" id="Line_2095"></a><br />
small force which was attacking so great a multitude.<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then the people of Sodoma was southward from<br />
there, to bear the news as to what rout of their fierce<br />
foes had occurred. Forthwith the king of the people,<br />
bereft of his nobles and stripped of friends, went out to<br />
meet Abraham; he brought with him the master of the<span class="linenum">2100</span><a name="Line_2100" id="Line_2100"></a><br />
treasure of Solomia: that was the great Melchisedec,<br />
bishop of the people. He came with gifts to greet fairly<br />
the prince of the warriors, [to approach] Abraham honor-<span class="linenum">2105</span><a name="Line_2105" id="Line_2105"></a><br />
ably, and he pronounced upon him the blessing of God<br />
and spoke thus:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Highly wert thou exalted among the number of heroes<br />
before the eyes of Him who gave thee the glory of the ash-<br />
spear in battle: that is God himself, who mightily de-<br />

thy weapons hew out bloody paths broadly [through the<br />
foe], regain the booty, and fell the warriors. They were<br />
encamped by the way: nor could the withdrawing army<br />
prevail in hand-to-hand conflict, but God put it to flight,<span class="linenum">2115</span><a name="Line_2115" id="Line_2115"></a><br />
who with His own hands preserved thee with thy warriors<br />
in the fight, against the terror of superior numbers, and<br />
[so likewise] the sacred pledge [preserved thee] which thou<br />
rightfully holdest with the Keeper of the skies.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
With his own hand the hero gave him a return for this<span class="linenum">2120</span><a name="Line_2120" id="Line_2120"></a><br />
blessing, and Abraham bestowed upon the bishop of God<br />
the value of every tenth part of the army's booty. Then<br />
spoke the war-king, ruler of Sodoma, bereft of his people,<br />
to Abraham, (to him mercy was needful):<span class="linenum">2125</span><a name="Line_2125" id="Line_2125"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Give me back the maidens of my people, whom thou<br />

&quot;Ruler of the people, I pledge to thee this my word,<span class="linenum">2140</span><a name="Line_2140" id="Line_2140"></a><br />
before the Holy One who is sole Master of heaven and<br />
this earth: there is no worldly treasure that I will take<br />
for my own, neither riches nor money of thine which I<br />
have rescued from the [hostile] bowmen, O great king,<br />
protector of thy nobles, lest thou oft hereafter say that<span class="linenum">2145</span><a name="Line_2145" id="Line_2145"></a><br />
I became rich on earth through the treasure and former<br />
wealth of the kingdom of Sodom;<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> but thou shalt<br />
take hence the booty which I regained for thee in battle,<span class="linenum">2150</span><a name="Line_2150" id="Line_2150"></a><br />
all except the shares of these noble warriors, Aner, and<br />
Mamre, and Escol. I am unwilling to deprive these<br />
warriors of their rights: for they stood by me in the<br />
combat, and fought in your behalf. Go now and take<br />
home the wrought gold and the beloved maidens, the<span class="linenum">2155</span><a name="Line_2155" id="Line_2155"></a><br />
womenfolk of thy people. Thou needst not fear for<br />
a while the attack of the hostile warriors, the battle<br />
of the northmen, for the birds of prey sit all smeared<br />
with blood, among the fastnesses of the mountains, well<span class="linenum">2160</span><a name="Line_2160" id="Line_2160"></a><br />
gorged with the slaughter of the armies.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
So the king set out on his return home with the spoils<br />
which the pious lord of the Hebrews, regardful of honor,<br />
gave up to him.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then again to Abraham the High-King of Heaven<span class="linenum">2165</span><a name="Line_2165" id="Line_2165"></a><br />
showed himself, with holy speech comforted the wise-<br />
hearted man, and spoke to him thus:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Great are thy rewards. Let not now thy heart<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 179</span><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>
grow idle, thou steadfast [doer] of my will. Nor needst<br />
thou fear anyone, while thou heedest my commandment,<br />
for with my own hands will I shelter and shield thee<span class="linenum">2170</span><a name="Line_2170" id="Line_2170"></a><br />
during thy life-time here against every woe: thou<br />
needst not be fearful.&quot;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham, famed for his deeds, answered his<br />
Lord and asked Him, in the fullness of his days:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;O Ruler of spirits, what dost thou give me for free-<span class="linenum">2175</span><a name="Line_2175" id="Line_2175"></a><br />
men's solace, now that I am thus solitary? I have no<br />
need to found an ancestral seat for any sons of mine, but<br />
after me shall my distant kinsmen dispose of my goods;<br />
thou hast not given me a son, and therefore sorrows<br />
weigh upon me very heavily in my heart; I myself can<span class="linenum">2180</span><a name="Line_2180" id="Line_2180"></a><br />
not devise any counsel. My steward goes rejoicing in<br />
his sons, and is firmly persuaded in his thoughts that<br />
after me his sons shall be the keepers of the heritage:<br />
they see that no children are born to me of my bride.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
To him then at once God answered:<span class="linenum">2185</span><a name="Line_2185" id="Line_2185"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Never shall thy steward possess the heritage of thy<br />
sons: but thine own children shall hold the treasure,<br />
when thy flesh lies [in the grave]. Behold the sky. Count<br />
those jewels, the stars of heaven, which now freely scatter<span class="linenum">2190</span><a name="Line_2190" id="Line_2190"></a><br />
their glorious radiance far and wide to shine brilliantly<br />
over the broad surface of the sea. Such shall be the<br />
multitude of thy descendants, rich in progeny. Let not<br />
thy heart be bound by sorrow. A son shall yet be born<span class="linenum">2195</span><a name="Line_2195" id="Line_2195"></a><br />
to thee, a child born of thy wife by ordinary birth, who<br />
after thee shall be the keeper of the inheritance, rich in<br />
property. Grieve no more: I am the Lord, who many<br />
winters ago led thee out of the stronghold of Caldea<span class="linenum">2200</span><a name="Line_2200" id="Line_2200"></a><br />
with but few followers, and promised thee a broad<br />
dwelling-place for thy possession: I give thee now my<br />
pledge, man of the Hebrews, that many a broad land<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 180</span><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a>
on this earth shall be peopled with thy progeny, regions<span class="linenum">2205</span><a name="Line_2205" id="Line_2205"></a><br />
of the world as far as Eufrates even from the borders<br />
of Egypt, as many men and as wide a kingdom as the<br />
Nile cuts off and the sea bounds: all this shall thy sons<span class="linenum">2210</span><a name="Line_2210" id="Line_2210"></a><br />
own, each of the countries, as these three waters sur-<br />
round with their streams the lofty cities of stone, the<br />
foamy floods [surround] the refuge of the people.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Sarra was grieved at heart that no son had come<span class="linenum">2215</span><a name="Line_2215" id="Line_2215"></a><br />
to Abraham through their wedlock, a free-born heir for<br />
their solace; so the sorrowful one began to speak to her<br />
husband in these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;The Ruler of heaven has denied me this, that I<span class="linenum">2220</span><a name="Line_2220" id="Line_2220"></a><br />
might augment the number of thy family under the<br />
skies with sons of thine own. Now I am hopeless that<br />
an heir will ever be given us together: I am too old, in<br />
my misery. My lord, do as I bid thee. Here is a<span class="linenum">2225</span><a name="Line_2225" id="Line_2225"></a><br />
woman, a fair damsel, an Egiptian maid in our possession:<br />
bid her now repair to thy bed forthwith, and see if<br />
the Lord will allow any heir for thy goods to come into<span class="linenum">2230</span><a name="Line_2230" id="Line_2230"></a><br />
the world through this woman!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the holy man yielded to the advice of his wife,<br />
and bade the handmaiden go to his couch as a bride.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a><span class="linenum">2235</span><a name="Line_2235" id="Line_2235"></a><br />
Her spirit exalted itself, when she had become pregnant<br />
with a man-child by Abraham; stiff-necked in scorn she<br />
began to despise her mistress, showed insolence, was<br />
overweening, and was unwilling to endure servitude but<span class="linenum">2240</span><a name="Line_2240" id="Line_2240"></a><br />
boldly began to resist Sarra strongly.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I heard how the wife spoke to her husband in the<br />
sorrow of her heart, with these words; sad in mind she<br />
spoke, and said bitterly:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Thou dost not deal properly and rightfully with me.<span class="linenum">2245</span><a name="Line_2245" id="Line_2245"></a><br />
Thou hast hitherto allowed it to happen that my hand-<br />
maiden afflict me every day by deed and word, ever<br />
since Agar entered thy bed in place of thy wife, as was<br />
my entreaty: she shall pay for this mercilessly, if I<span class="linenum">2250</span><a name="Line_2250" id="Line_2250"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 181</span><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>
may still control mine own before thee, dear Abraham;<br />
of this may the Almighty Lord of Lords be judge<br />
between us two!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
The wise-minded man then answered her at once in<span class="linenum">2255</span><a name="Line_2255" id="Line_2255"></a><br />
these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Never shall I leave thee without honor, while we<br />
both live; but thou must manage thine own maid as<br />
pleases thy heart!&quot;<br />
</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham's queen became unkind, wrathful in<span class="linenum">2260</span><a name="Line_2260" id="Line_2260"></a><br />
heart towards her serving-maid, hard and cruel, spoke<br />
bitter insults to the woman. Thereupon the latter fled<br />
from threat and thraldom: she would not endure evil<br />
and retribution for what she had formerly done to Sarra,<span class="linenum">2265</span><a name="Line_2265" id="Line_2265"></a><br />
but went forth on a journey to go into the wilderness.<br />
There a servant of glory, an angel of the Lord, found her<br />
sorrowing; he eagerly asked her:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Whither do you intend to push your journey, my<span class="linenum">2270</span><a name="Line_2270" id="Line_2270"></a><br />
poor woman? Sarre owns thy service!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
She answered him at once:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Deprived of every pleasure, jeered out of the house<br />
by the hatred of my mistress, I have fled from woes,<br />
afflictions, and injuries. Now with tear-stained cheek<br />
must I await my fate<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> in the wilderness, [the time]<span class="linenum">2275</span><a name="Line_2275" id="Line_2275"></a><br />
when hunger or a wolf removes life and sorrow together<br />
from my heart.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the angel answered her:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Seek not thou in flight far hence to avoid thy con-<span class="linenum">2280</span><a name="Line_2280" id="Line_2280"></a><br />
cubinage, but return again, earn honor for thyself, begin<br />
submissively to cultivate dutifulness, become dear to<br />
thy master. Thou shalt, Agar, bring a son into the world<br />
to Abraham: with my word I tell thee now that this<span class="linenum">2285</span><a name="Line_2285" id="Line_2285"></a><br />
man-child shall be called Ismahel, among men. He<br />
shall be rough, warlike, hostile to the races of men and<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 182</span><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>
to his own kinsfolk: many a one shall struggle against<span class="linenum">2290</span><a name="Line_2290" id="Line_2290"></a><br />
him in wrath, with assault of arms. From this prince<br />
nations shall spring, numberless peoples. Depart now<br />
to seek thy master again: live with those who own thee!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
In accordance with the angel's command, she at once<br />
returned to her lord, as the holy spirit-messenger of God<span class="linenum">2295</span><a name="Line_2295" id="Line_2295"></a><br />
bade her, in sapient speech. Thus was Ismael born to<br />
Abraham, even when he had [lived] 86 winters in the<br />
world. The son grew and flourished, as the angel, the<span class="linenum">2300</span><a name="Line_2300" id="Line_2300"></a><br />
true minister of peace, had promised to the woman by<br />
his own word.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
About thirteen years after that, the Lord and Ever-<br />
lasting King spoke with Abraham:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Dear man, as I command thee, so do thou keep well<br />
our covenant: I will to all time exalt thee in blessings.<span class="linenum">2305</span><a name="Line_2305" id="Line_2305"></a><br />
Be thou zealously observant of my will in thy deeds:<br />
I will still further confirm with truth the pledge which<br />
I gave to thee as earnest of comfort, when thy spirit<br />
grieved. Thou shalt hallow thy household: set a true<span class="linenum">2310</span><a name="Line_2310" id="Line_2310"></a><br />
sign of victory on each one of the male sex, if thou wilt<br />

[always] be keeper and sustainer of this people, if thou<span class="linenum">2315</span><a name="Line_2315" id="Line_2315"></a><br />
dost obey me in thy innermost thoughts and art willing<br />
to fulfil my commands. In his infancy shall every<br />
individual of the male sex in this race, about seven nights<br />
after he comes into the world, be marked for me with<span class="linenum">2320</span><a name="Line_2320" id="Line_2320"></a><br />
the sign of victory, or from the face of the earth be<br />
driven far through my hostility, thrust out from his<br />
possessions. Do as I bid: I will be true to you all, if<br />
ye bear that sign with true faith. Thou shalt possess<span class="linenum">2325</span><a name="Line_2325" id="Line_2325"></a><br />
a son, a child by thy wife, whom men shall all call Isaac.<br />
Nor needst thou be ashamed of this son: but I will give<br />
to this man-child my divine gifts, by the might of the<br />
spirit, abundance of friends, with prosperity. He shall<span class="linenum">2330</span><a name="Line_2330" id="Line_2330"></a><br />
receive my grace and blessing, love and favor. From<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 183</span><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>
this prince shall come broad nations, shall arise many<br />
famous warriors, keepers of kingdoms, world-kings widely<span class="linenum">2335</span><a name="Line_2335" id="Line_2335"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham in haste laid his cheek on the earth,<br />
and with scorn turned over these words in his mind, the<br />
thoughts of his heart: at that period of time he himself<span class="linenum">2340</span><a name="Line_2340" id="Line_2340"></a><br />
did not believe that Sarra, his grey-haired bride, could<br />
bring a son into the world to him; he knew well that his<br />
wife had already numbered at least one hundred winters,<br />
by actual reckoning. So then, wise in years, he spoke<span class="linenum">2345</span><a name="Line_2345" id="Line_2345"></a><br />
thus to the Lord:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;May Ismael live according to Thy commandments,<br />
Lord, and give thee thanks with wise and steady mind<br />
and stout heart, doing Thy will day and night in word<span class="linenum">2350</span><a name="Line_2350" id="Line_2350"></a><br />
and deed!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the Almighty King and Everlasting Lord an-<br />
swered him fairly:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Though much worn in years, Sarra shall bring a son<br />
into the world to thee; the future shall truly proceed in<span class="linenum">2355</span><a name="Line_2355" id="Line_2355"></a><br />
accordance with these words here pronounced. I will now<br />
bless with my grace Ismael, as thou art petitioner, for<br />
thy first born, so that he may dwell many days in the<br />
kingdom of this world with spreading progeny; be thou<span class="linenum">2360</span><a name="Line_2360" id="Line_2360"></a><br />
sure of that! But Isaac thy son, the young child who<br />
has not yet come into the world, I will distinguish ex-<br />
ceedingly with abundance of joys and every kind of<br />
riches, in his days, and certainly leave in his heart my<span class="linenum">2365</span><a name="Line_2365" id="Line_2365"></a><br />
pledge and holy faith, and be kind to him.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Abraham did as the Eternal bade him, set the sign<br />
of peace on his son, by the Lord's command, and bade<span class="linenum">2370</span><a name="Line_2370" id="Line_2370"></a><br />
every one of his household of the male sex bear that<br />
high sign,&mdash;wise in heart, and mindful of the pledge<br />
which God had given him as assurance of good faith,&mdash;<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 184</span><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>
and then himself received the exalted sign. The Lord<span class="linenum">2375</span><a name="Line_2375" id="Line_2375"></a><br />
and Just King continually advanced his glory in the<br />
kingdom of this world, with blessings: He wrought this<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then the woman laughed at the Lord of Mankind not<span class="linenum">2380</span><a name="Line_2380" id="Line_2380"></a><br />
at all mirthfully, but full of years she laid away this<br />
promise in her mind with much scorn: she did not<br />
believe it true that the fulfilment of this promise was to<br />
follow. But when the Ruler of Heaven heard that the<span class="linenum">2385</span><a name="Line_2385" id="Line_2385"></a><br />
wife of Abraham had given way to hopeless laughter,<br />
in her bower, then the Holy God said:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Sarra will not believe in the truth of my word:<br />
nevertheless this decree shall be fulfilled, as I promised<span class="linenum">2390</span><a name="Line_2390" id="Line_2390"></a><br />
thee at first. I tell thee truth, at this very season a son<br />

Then at once, after this speech, they departed with<br />
speed, eager to be gone; from the place of the confer-<br />

light itself was in their midst!) until they could look<br />
upon Sodom, the lofty city: they saw palaces tower up<br />

<p class="nowrap">
The men with their wives were approaching their<br />
punishment, sufferings within their walls: arrogant in<br />
riches, they requited the Lord for their prosperity with<span class="linenum">2420</span><a name="Line_2420" id="Line_2420"></a><br />
insult, until the Protector of spirits, the Source of Light<br />
and Life, would tolerate their offence no longer: but to<br />
them the steadfast King sent two strong messengers<br />
of his, who arrived at eventide at the fortress of Sodoma,<span class="linenum">2425</span><a name="Line_2425" id="Line_2425"></a><br />
in their traveling. At the city-gate they found the<br />
warrior, the son of Aron, sitting by himself, so that they<br />
appeared before the eyes of the wise man as young men.<br />
Then the servant of the Lord arose before the spirits,<span class="linenum">2430</span><a name="Line_2430" id="Line_2430"></a><br />
went forward to greet the strangers civilly, thought their<br />
demeanor very proper and agreeable, and invited the<br />
men to be his guests for the night. The noble messengers<br />
of our Preserver answered him thus:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;For the courtesy which you have extended to us,<span class="linenum">2435</span><a name="Line_2435" id="Line_2435"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then humbly Loth<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> bowed at the feet of the strangers<span class="linenum">2440</span><a name="Line_2440" id="Line_2440"></a><br />
and eagerly offered them the repose and refreshments<br />
and shelter and service of his dwelling. They accepted<br />
thankfully the benevolence of the good man, and followed<br />
him forthwith inside his walls, as the Hebrew chieftain<br />
invited them. There in his hall the generous wise-<span class="linenum">2445</span><a name="Line_2445" id="Line_2445"></a><br />
souled man gave them fair hospitality, until twilight<br />
departed: then came night, after the close of day, and<br />
veiled with darkness the lake-streams, seas, and broad<span class="linenum">2450</span><a name="Line_2450" id="Line_2450"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 186</span><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>

Sodoma came, young and old, hateful to God, to demand<br />
the strangers, with a great throng so that they surrounded<span class="linenum">2455</span><a name="Line_2455" id="Line_2455"></a><br />
Loth and his guests by the multitude of their force;<br />
they bade [him] lead out of the lofty hall the holy mess-<br />

openly in words that they would have intercourse with<br />
the men shamefully, and had no regard for decency. Then<span class="linenum">2460</span><a name="Line_2460" id="Line_2460"></a><br />
Loth, who often knew what was best, quickly arose in his<br />
house, and went out at once; and the son of Aron, mindful<br />
of his cunning, spoke thus over all the mass of people:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Here are within two spotless [maidens], my daughters:<span class="linenum">2465</span><a name="Line_2465" id="Line_2465"></a><br />
neither of these damsels knows intercourse as yet through<br />
sleeping with a man: do then as I bid you, and cease<br />
from this sin. I give them both to you, before you<br />

the sons of men. Receive these maidens and let my<br />
guests go free, since I will defend them against you as<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Thereupon the crowd, the shameless race, answered<span class="linenum">2475</span><a name="Line_2475" id="Line_2475"></a><br />
him through common consent:<br />

<p class="nowrap">
&quot;It seems very right and fitting that thou shouldst<br />

from afar, in thy need: wilt thou, if thou mayst, be our<span class="linenum">2480</span><a name="Line_2480" id="Line_2480"></a><br />
ruler here, the teacher of the people?&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then I heard of Loth how the heathen masses gripped<br />
him with their hands, with hostile grasp: his guests<br />
aided him well and the righteous strangers drew him<span class="linenum">2485</span><a name="Line_2485" id="Line_2485"></a><br />
out of the clutches of the enemy back within the walls,<br />
and then speedily closed fast the eyesight of every one<br />
of the people of Sodoma standing around: the whole<span class="linenum">2490</span><a name="Line_2490" id="Line_2490"></a><br />
crowd of citizens forthwith became blind; nor could<br />
they, in their evil rage, break into the house after the<br />
guests, as they intended, but the messengers of God<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 187</span><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>
were [too] active for them; the stranger had power, irre-<span class="linenum">2495</span><a name="Line_2495" id="Line_2495"></a><br />
sistible vigor, and was very severe upon the people in<br />
[inflicting] punishment. Then the dear ministers of<br />
peace spoke fairly to Loth, in these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;If thou hast a son, or dear relative, or any friend<br />
among these people besides these maidens whom we see<span class="linenum">2500</span><a name="Line_2500" id="Line_2500"></a><br />
here, lead out of this city those who are dear to thee, with<br />
great haste, and save thine own life, lest thou perish<br />
with these law-breakers. For the Lord has commanded<br />
us, because of the people's sins, to give over Sodoma and<span class="linenum">2505</span><a name="Line_2505" id="Line_2505"></a><br />
Gomorra to black flame and fire, and to slay these people,<br />
[striking] the race in their cities with deadly horrors,<br />
and so wreak His wrath [upon them]. It has nearly<br />
reached the appointed time. Set out on thy way, to<br />
save thy life: the Lord is merciful to thee....&quot;<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a><span class="linenum">2510</span><a name="Line_2510" id="Line_2510"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Loth then hastily answered them:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;I cannot, with these womenfolk, seek my safety<br />
so far from here in a journey on foot. You manifest<br />
to me kindness and fair friendship, you grant me grace<span class="linenum">2515</span><a name="Line_2515" id="Line_2515"></a><br />
and good-will. I know a lofty town near here, a little<br />
fortress: leave me there, in honor and peace, so that we<br />
may seek safety above, in Sigor. If you will protect that<span class="linenum">2520</span><a name="Line_2520" id="Line_2520"></a><br />
lofty fastness from the fire, we can abide in that place<br />
unharmed, in safety, and so preserve our lives.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the righteous angels answered him benevol-<span class="linenum">2525</span><a name="Line_2525" id="Line_2525"></a><br />
ently:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Thou shalt be successful in this petition, now thou<br />
speakest about that city: withdraw immediately to that<br />
fastness. We shall keep thee in peace and safety. We<br />
must not wreak the wrath of God upon these law-<span class="linenum">2530</span><a name="Line_2530" id="Line_2530"></a><br />
breakers and destroy the sinful race, before thou hast<br />
led thy children and wife likewise into S&aelig;gor.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the kinsman of Abraham set out for the fastness:<br />
the chieftain did not spare the pace for his womenfolk,<span class="linenum">2535</span><a name="Line_2535" id="Line_2535"></a><br />
but he pushed his steps most hastily until he had brought<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 188</span><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>
his wife and children to the citadel of S&aelig;gor. When the<br />
sun rose, [when] the peaceful luminary of the nations<br />
went forth, then, I have heard, the Master of Glory sent<span class="linenum">2540</span><a name="Line_2540" id="Line_2540"></a><br />
sulphur out of heaven, and swart flame for the punish-<br />
ment of men, swelling fire, since they had offended the<br />
Lord for a long period in former days: thus the Ruler of<br />
spirits gave them retribution. Utmost terror seized upon<span class="linenum">2545</span><a name="Line_2545" id="Line_2545"></a><br />
the heathen race: tumult arose in the city, the outcry<br />
of the accursed race over shameful death, just beginning.<br />
The flame seized upon all that it found green, in the rich<br />
city, just as around outside no small portion of the broad<span class="linenum">2550</span><a name="Line_2550" id="Line_2550"></a><br />
earth was filled with conflagration and terror: trees<br />
and earth's harvests turned to ashes and embers, even<br />
as far as the avenging curse direly extended over the<span class="linenum">2555</span><a name="Line_2555" id="Line_2555"></a><br />
broad country of the people. The devastating fire<br />
rushing on in tumult devoured all things together, far<br />
and wide, that men had owned in the cities of Sodoma<br />
and Gomorra: all this, together with the people, God<span class="linenum">2560</span><a name="Line_2560" id="Line_2560"></a><br />
the Lord destroyed.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
When Loth's wife, his bride in the city, heard the din<br />
of fire, the death of the people, then she looked back-<br />
ward [to see] this devastation. The Scriptures tell us<br />
that she immediately turned into the likeness of a pillar<br />
of salt: ever since then this statue has stood there<span class="linenum">2565</span><a name="Line_2565" id="Line_2565"></a><br />
motion less (this is a strange story), where she incurred<br />
this severe penalty because she would not obey the<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then Abraham went forth alone, at dawn, so that he<span class="linenum">2575</span><a name="Line_2575" id="Line_2575"></a><br />
again stood in the place where the pious leader had<br />
formerly spoken with his Lord in words. He saw the<br />
reek of death and destruction ascending widely from<br />
the earth. Riches and feasting preoccupied [the people]<br />
to such an extent that they had become bold in wicked<span class="linenum">2580</span><a name="Line_2580" id="Line_2580"></a><br />
deeds, eager for sin: they forgot the Truth and God's<br />
commandments, and who had given them prosperity<br />
and wealth in their cities; therefore the King of the<br />
Angels sent his fervid fire to punish them. Our faithful<span class="linenum">2585</span><a name="Line_2585" id="Line_2585"></a><br />
Lord then remembered Abraham mercifully, the dear<br />
man, as he often had done, and saved his kinsman, Loth,<br />
when the multitude perished. The [latter] hero, famed<br />
for his deeds, did not dare to tarry longer in the strong-<span class="linenum">2590</span><a name="Line_2590" id="Line_2590"></a><br />
hold for fear of the Lord, but Loth departed from the<br />
city with his children to seek a dwelling-place far from<br />
the place of slaughter, until they found a cave in the<br />
side of a high dune: there the pious Loth, dear to his<span class="linenum">2595</span><a name="Line_2595" id="Line_2595"></a><br />
Lord, dwelt in righteousness for a great number of days,<br />
with his two daughters....<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
They did thus with the drunken man: ... the elder<br />
of the two went first to her father's bed. Nor did the<span class="linenum">2600</span><a name="Line_2600" id="Line_2600"></a><br />
venerable man know when the two maidens ... were<br />
with him in the manner of a bride, fast bound [as he<br />
was] in heart, mind, and memory, drunken with wine,<span class="linenum">2605</span><a name="Line_2605" id="Line_2605"></a><br />
so that he could not escape the enterprise of the maidens.<br />
The young women became pregnant, and the devoted<br />
sisters brought men-children into the world, sons to<br />
their old father. One of these noble children was called<br />
Moab by his mother, that daughter of Loth who was the<span class="linenum">2610</span><a name="Line_2610" id="Line_2610"></a><br />
elder in years of life; the Scriptures tell us, the sacred<br />
Books, that the younger called her son Ammon. From<br />
these princes sprang numberless people, the glories of<span class="linenum">2615</span><a name="Line_2615" id="Line_2615"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
Then the brother of Aron set out with his wife to take<span class="linenum">2620</span><a name="Line_2620" id="Line_2620"></a><br />
his possessions and his household to Abimelech. Abra-<br />

preserved his life by his words: he knew very well that<span class="linenum">2625</span><a name="Line_2625" id="Line_2625"></a><br />
he had few relatives and friends among that people.<br />
Then the king sent his ministers and bade them bring<br />
to him [the wife of Abraham].<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Thus for the second<br />
time in a foreign land, the wife of Abraham was taken<span class="linenum">2630</span><a name="Line_2630" id="Line_2630"></a><br />
from her husband to the embrace of a stranger. Then<br />
the eternal Lord assisted him, as he had often done:<br />
our Preserver came himself by night to where the king<br />
lay drunken with wine. Thereupon the Lord of Truth<span class="linenum">2635</span><a name="Line_2635" id="Line_2635"></a><br />
began to speak to the king through a dream, and threat-<br />
ened him in wrath:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Thou hast taken Abraham's wife, his bride from the<br />
hero; for that deed death shall tear thy soul from thy<br />
breast!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
To him thus the sinner, gorged with feasting, replied<span class="linenum">2640</span><a name="Line_2640" id="Line_2640"></a><br />
in his sleep:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;What! Wilt Thou ever, High King of the Angels,<br />
through thy wrath let him be deprived of life who lives<span class="linenum">2645</span><a name="Line_2645" id="Line_2645"></a><br />
here in righteous habits, [who] in his counsel is upright<br />
in mind, and who asks mercy of Thyself? In her own<br />
words, unasked, this woman told me first that she was<span class="linenum">2650</span><a name="Line_2650" id="Line_2650"></a><br />
Abraham's sister. I have not sinned against her, nor<br />
wrought any evil at all, up to this time!&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then again the Eternal Lord and True God spoke to<br />
him straightway through that dream:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Give back this woman to Abraham, his wife, into<span class="linenum">2655</span><a name="Line_2655" id="Line_2655"></a><br />
his possession, if thou wishest for life any longer in this<br />
world, as protector of the nobles. He is good and wise,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 191</span><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>
and may himself speak with [God] and see the King of<br />
Glory. Thou shalt die, with thy flocks and thy sub-<br />
stance, if thou deniest his wife to the warrior: if he will<span class="linenum">2660</span><a name="Line_2660" id="Line_2660"></a><br />
at once honestly and patiently prefer to me thy earnest<br />
wishes, he may obtain his request that I yet allow thee<br />
living to enjoy pleasures and prosperity in thy days,<span class="linenum">2665</span><a name="Line_2665" id="Line_2665"></a><br />
[allow thee] in sound health [to enjoy thy] riches.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the keeper of the people broke forth from sleep,<br />
bade his councillors come to him; shaken with terror,<br />
Abimeleh quickly told the nobles the word of the Master.<br />
The men dreaded [as retribution] for this deed, blows<span class="linenum">2670</span><a name="Line_2670" id="Line_2670"></a><br />
from the hand of the Lord in accordance with the dream.<br />
The king himself bade them bring Abraham before him,<br />
in great haste. Then the ruler of the kingdom spoke:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Man of the Ebrews! this wilt thou now tell me in<span class="linenum">2675</span><a name="Line_2675" id="Line_2675"></a><br />
words: what have I done that, since thou broughtest<br />
thy possessions into this country among us, Abraham,<br />
thou hast thus bitterly contrived a plot against me?<br />
Thou, a foreigner, wouldst deceive us in this country<span class="linenum">2680</span><a name="Line_2680" id="Line_2680"></a><br />
with evil and pollute us with sin: thou saidest in plain<br />
words that Sarra was thy sister, thy blood relation;<br />
through that woman thou wouldst have foully put upon<br />
me sin, measureless evil! We received thee honorably,<span class="linenum">2685</span><a name="Line_2685" id="Line_2685"></a><br />
and in friendship gave thee a dwelling-place among this<br />

Abraham then answered:<span class="linenum">2690</span><a name="Line_2690" id="Line_2690"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;I did that, not for evil nor for hostility nor for any<br />
woe that I might bring upon thee. But by this strat-<br />
agem, O ruler of men, I protected myself against blows<br />
of the fierce sword, far from my kinsfolk [as I was]<br />
Since the Holy One<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> first led me from the family of<span class="linenum">2695</span><a name="Line_2695" id="Line_2695"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 192</span><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a>
the prince, my father, I have sought out many peoples,<br />
strange allies, and this woman with me, destitute of<br />
friends: I always kept this peril in mind, when some foe<span class="linenum">2700</span><a name="Line_2700" id="Line_2700"></a><br />
should deprive me&mdash;a stranger&mdash;of my life, who wished<br />
to have this woman for his own. Therefore I have told<br />
warriors in plain words that Sarra was my sister, wher-<span class="linenum">2705</span><a name="Line_2705" id="Line_2705"></a><br />
ever on this earth we have had to contend against<br />
foreigners in our exile. I did the same thing in this<br />
country, great king, after I chose thy protection: nor<br />
was there any knowledge in my heart as to whether<span class="linenum">2710</span><a name="Line_2710" id="Line_2710"></a><br />
the fear of God Almighty was in this race, when I first<br />

from thyself as well as possible the true statement that<br />
Sarra was wont to enter my bed with me as my wife.&quot;<span class="linenum">2715</span><a name="Line_2715" id="Line_2715"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then Abim&aelig;leh began to enrich Abraham with worldly<br />
treasures and returned his wife to him: he gave him<br />
to boot, when he received his wife, live stock and bright<br />
silver and serving-folk. The protector of the nobles<span class="linenum">2720</span><a name="Line_2720" id="Line_2720"></a><br />
spoke further to Abraham, in these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Dwell with us and choose thee a dwelling-place in<br />
this land, a noble site where it is most to thy liking: I<br />
must have thee; be a faithful friend to us; we will give<span class="linenum">2725</span><a name="Line_2725" id="Line_2725"></a><br />
thee riches.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then quickly the dispenser of treasure spoke further<br />
to Sarra, in other words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Nor need Abraham, thy lord and master, set it in<br />
reproach against thee that thou hast trodden the ways<br />
of my dwelling, O woman goddess-fair: for I have richly<span class="linenum">2730</span><a name="Line_2730" id="Line_2730"></a><br />
repaired thine offence with him, with white silver. Do<br />
not trouble yourselves to seek riches and strange friends<br />
away from this land, but dwell here.&quot;<br />

<p class="nowrap">
Abraham did as his king bade him, and at the ruler's<span class="linenum">2735</span><a name="Line_2735" id="Line_2735"></a><br />
behest accepted friendship, love, and peace. He was<br />
dear to God: therefore he enjoyed tranquility happily<br />
and proceeded under the shadow of his Creator, covered<span class="linenum">2740</span><a name="Line_2740" id="Line_2740"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 193</span><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>
by His protecting wings, while he lived. But God<br />
was still angry at Abimeleh for the sin which he had<br />
committed against Sarra and Abraham, when he sepa-<br />
rated these two loving ones, the wife and the husband.<span class="linenum">2745</span><a name="Line_2745" id="Line_2745"></a><br />
He received a severe penalty for this deed: for neither<br />
free nor slave women could reward<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> the men their<br />
masters with children, for the Lord prevented it, until<br />
the holy Abraham began to pray Eternal God for grace<span class="linenum">2750</span><a name="Line_2750" id="Line_2750"></a><br />
in behalf of his king. The Protector of the Angels granted<br />
him his prayer, and restored to the king the fertility<br />
of the free and the enslaved, men and women; again<br />
the Ruler of the skies allowed the number of their off-<span class="linenum">2755</span><a name="Line_2755" id="Line_2755"></a><br />
spring to increase, their prosperity and possessions: the<br />
Almighty Keeper of Mankind became mild in heart<br />
towards Abimeleh, as Abraham entreated Him.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the Almighty Lord came to Sarra, as He Himself<span class="linenum">2760</span><a name="Line_2760" id="Line_2760"></a><br />
promised: Our Master, the Ruler of Life, had fulfilled His<br />

with child by the chieftain. Abraham with his own hand<br />
set the sign upon him, as the Lord glorious in splendor<br />
bade him, about a week from the time when his mother<span class="linenum">2770</span><a name="Line_2770" id="Line_2770"></a><br />

<p class="nowrap">
The boy grew and throve, inasmuch as noble [traits]<br />
were native to him from his ancestors. Abraham had<br />
[numbered] 100 years when, to his joy, his wife bore him<br />
a son: he had waited for this for a long time, since the<span class="linenum">2775</span><a name="Line_2775" id="Line_2775"></a><br />
Lord first through His own word foretold this day of<br />
happiness. Now the matter so happened that his wife<br />
once saw Ismael playing before Abraham where they<br />
were both seated at a banquet, holy in heart, and all<span class="linenum">2780</span><a name="Line_2780" id="Line_2780"></a><br /><span class="pagenum">Page 194</span><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>
their household retainers were drinking and singing.<br />
Then the noble woman spoke, as wife to husband:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Forgive me, my dear lord, keeper of the ring! But<br />
bid Agar depart elsewhere, and take Ismael with her.<span class="linenum">2785</span><a name="Line_2785" id="Line_2785"></a><br />
We should no longer be together, for my pleasure, if I<br />
might have my way. Never shall Ismael share the<br />
heritage with Isaac, my own son, after thee, when thou<br />
yieldest up thy spirit from the body.&quot;<span class="linenum">2790</span><a name="Line_2790" id="Line_2790"></a><br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then was Abraham heavy at heart, because he must<br />
drive away his own son into exile; then speedily the<br />
True God came to his aid, for He knew that the heart<br />
of the man was in dire straits. The King of the Angels,<span class="linenum">2795</span><a name="Line_2795" id="Line_2795"></a><br />
the Eternal Lord, spoke to Abraham:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Let the sorrow and heart-felt grief slip from thy<br />

Then Abraham gave pledges to Abimeleh that he would<br />
[do] thus.<br />

<div class="pagenum"><a href="#ToC">ToC</a></div>
<p class="nowrap">
After this the holy son of Thare, chief of the Ebrews,<br />
was a dweller in the Filistine nation for a long time,<span class="linenum">2835</span><a name="Line_2835" id="Line_2835"></a><br />
alone amid strangers. The Lord of the Angels showed<br />
him a dwelling-place which the men dwelling in the city<br />
called the land of Bersaba. There the pious man built<br />
a high hall, constructed a place of shelter and planted<span class="linenum">2840</span><a name="Line_2840" id="Line_2840"></a><br />
a grove, erected an altar and on the sacrificial stone<br />
made an offering, an oblation, at once, to his Master<br />
who had given him a prosperous life under the sky.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then the powerful King began to try this hero,<span class="linenum">2845</span><a name="Line_2845" id="Line_2845"></a><br />
tested stringently what the noble one's fortitude was,<br />
and spoke to him in stern words with his voice:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Go forth now speedily, Abraham, hasten thy steps,<span class="linenum">2850</span><a name="Line_2850" id="Line_2850"></a><br />
and take with thee thine own child. Thou shalt thyself<br />
offer up Isaac to me, thy son as a sacrifice. After thou<br />
ascendest on foot the steep dune, the bordering circle of<br />
that high land which I shall show thee from here, there<span class="linenum">2855</span><a name="Line_2855" id="Line_2855"></a><br />
thou shalt prepare a funeral pyre, the death-pile of thy<br />
son, and then thyself sacrifice thy son with the edge<br />
of the sword and then burn his dear body with black<br />
flame, and thus make offering to me.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
He did not decline the expedition, but straightway<br />
began to hasten the procedure: the word of the King<span class="linenum">2860</span><a name="Line_2860" id="Line_2860"></a><br />
of Angels was sacred to him, and his Master was beloved.<br />
Then the pious Abraham forsook his nightly repose,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 196</span><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>
with no resistance at all to the command of the Saviour,<br />
but the holy man girded himself with his grey sword<span class="linenum">2865</span><a name="Line_2865" id="Line_2865"></a><br />
and declared that the fear of the Keeper of Spirits<br />
dwelt in his breast. Worn with age, the dispenser of<br />
gold began to harness his asses, and bade two young men<br />
go with him: his own son was the third and he himself<br />
the fourth. Without delay he then set out to lead Isaac<span class="linenum">2870</span><a name="Line_2870" id="Line_2870"></a><br />
from his own home, the ungrown child, as the Lord<br />
bade him; hastened exceedingly and hurried forth on<br />
the way, as the Lord showed him the paths over the<br />
wastes, until the glorious beginning of the third day<span class="linenum">2875</span><a name="Line_2875" id="Line_2875"></a><br />
arose across deep water. There the worthy man saw<br />
a high dune rise, as the King of Glory had foretold to<br />
him. So Abraham spoke to his servants:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;My men! Remain ye here in this place. We shall<span class="linenum">2880</span><a name="Line_2880" id="Line_2880"></a><br />
return, after we have offered to the King of Spirits what<br />
was entrusted to us both.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
The noble man then departed with his own son toward<span class="linenum">2885</span><a name="Line_2885" id="Line_2885"></a><br />
the designated spot which the Lord showed him, striding<br />
through the forest; the son bore the wood, the father<br />
fire and sword. Then the man young in years began<br />
to ask Abraham about the affair, in these words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;We have here fire and sword, my lord: where is the<span class="linenum">2890</span><a name="Line_2890" id="Line_2890"></a><br />
noble victim that you expect to bring as a burnt-offering<br />
to God?&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Abraham replied (he had once for all decided that he<br />
would do as the Lord directed him):<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;That the True King, Guardian of mankind, will<span class="linenum">2895</span><a name="Line_2895" id="Line_2895"></a><br />
himself provide, as it seemeth to him meet.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
Then with unfaltering purpose he ascended the steep<br />
dune, with his son, as the Eternal had bidden him, until<br />
he stood on the crest of the high land, on the [spot]<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a><br />
which the mighty, faithful Lord had shown him in his<span class="linenum">2900</span><a name="Line_2900" id="Line_2900"></a><br />
words. Forthwith he began to build the funeral-pyre<br />
and kindle the fire, and he bound his son hand and foot,<br /><span class="pagenum">Page 197</span><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>
and then laid young Isaac on the pile, and then straight-<br />
way grasped the sword by the hilt: he was resolved to<span class="linenum">2905</span><a name="Line_2905" id="Line_2905"></a><br />
kill his son with his own hands and allay the flames with<br />
his child's blood.<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
At that moment a minister of God, one of the angels,<br />
called Abraham from above, with a loud voice. Motion-<br />
less he answered the angel and awaited the herald's<span class="linenum">2910</span><a name="Line_2910" id="Line_2910"></a><br />
speech. To him then forthwith God's glorious spirit-<br />
messenger spoke from above, out of heaven, in these<br />
words:<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
&quot;Beloved Abraham! Do not slay thine own son, but<br />
take the boy alive from the pile, thy child. The God<span class="linenum">2915</span><a name="Line_2915" id="Line_2915"></a><br />
of Glory has spared him. Prince of the Ebrews, through<br />
the holy hand of the King of Heaven thou shalt thyself<br />
receive recompense and true rewards of victory, ample<br />
gifts: the Keeper of Spirits will enrich thee with blessings,<span class="linenum">2920</span><a name="Line_2920" id="Line_2920"></a><br />
because his peace and favor were dearer to thee than<br />
thine own child.&quot;<br />
</p>
<p class="nowrap">
The pyre stood there blazing. The Lord of mankind<br />
had made joyful the breast of Abraham, kinsman of<br />
Loth, when he gave him back his son, Isaac, alive. Then<span class="linenum">2925</span><a name="Line_2925" id="Line_2925"></a><br />
the holy hero looked about over his shoulder, and there<br />
not far from him the brother of Aron beheld a ram<br />
standing alone, caught fast in the thorn-bushes. Abra-<br />
ham took this and laid it on the pyre with great zeal,<span class="linenum">2930</span><a name="Line_2930" id="Line_2930"></a><br />
in place of his own son, brandished the sword, and dec-<br />
orated the burnt-offering, the smoking altar, with the<br />
blood of the ram, offered that oblation to God, [and fin-<br />
ally] gave thanks for these blessings and for all those<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a><br />

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Thorpe's translation of the <i>Genesis</i>, published with his
edition, in 1828, was not accessible to the present writer and
presumably will not be accessible to the general public, so that on the
mere score of availability it seems high time for the appearance of
another translation; moreover, in the last eighty-five years critical
scholarship has produced a greatly improved text of the poem.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Aside from necessary omissions made for <i>Genesis B</i>, the
Sections are numbered consecutively in this translation (regardless of
vagaries in the original MS. numbering), on the assumption that each
illuminated capital in the MS. was intended to indicate the beginning of
a new Section. After the excision of <i>Genesis B</i>, the numbering has been
resumed with X instead of XV, because the XIII at line 440 in the MS.
must really represent VIII.&mdash;Cf. Note 8, page 59, inf. (page 199, inf.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> ll. 39b-41a. <i>Wr&aelig;cna</i>, gen. pl. with <i>bidan</i>, = <i>outcasts</i>; I
take <i>weardas</i> as in apposition with it (the acc. being either a scribal
error or an anacoluthon), and then translate <i>wr&aelig;cna</i> as an adjective
for the sake of idiomatic fluency. For <i>gasta weardas</i> as an epithet for
angels, though then unfallen, cf. line 12a, sup.&mdash;The passage has given
scholars much trouble and is unsatisfactory, at best.</p></div>

Doubtless the remaining events of the third day, with those of the
fourth, fifth, and perhaps first part of the sixth, days, including the
creation of man, (i.e., apparently the contents of Gen. 1.11-2.17,
incl.) were retold in these pages.</p></div>

for the second hemistich seems to be wanting. As the sense is complete,
without emendation, I have not followed the various scholars who would
insert after &quot;Adam's bride&quot; some such clause as, &quot;Whom God named Eve.&quot;</p></div>

widely in their conjectural emendations and interpretations. Since none
of their versions is satisfactory or convincing, I venture upon an
independent reading. <i>Hebeleac</i>, of course, is the Scriptural Havilah
(Gen. 2.11); <i>Fison</i> is obviously Pison, and <i>Geon</i>, 230b inf., is
Gihon.<span class="pagenum">Page 199</span><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></p></div>

Sievers has shown that the following 617 lines, called <i>Genesis B</i>, were
written and interpolated later, by a different hand, and have Old Saxon
affiliations. <i>Genesis B</i> describes the Fall of Man and also gives a new
version of the revolt and overthrow of Satan. <i>Genesis A</i> begins again,
at line 852, with the conversation between Adam and Eve and Jehovah
(Gen. 3.8 ff.).</p></div>

begins with the tenth large decorative initial, the others having
occurred at ll. 1, 82, 135, 246, 389, 442, 547, 684, and 821. Where the
editors so widely disagree as to the proper subdivisions of the poem, it
seems safer to follow the original initializing (but not the marginal
numbering of the original MS.: this skips from VII to XIII at line
440&mdash;doubtless accidentally substituting X for V&mdash;and is otherwise
irregular). Cf. footnote, page vi, sup.&mdash;For lines 869-70, cf. <i>Jour.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
